  abstract = {We show that publishing results using the statistical significance filter---publishing only when the p-value is less than 0.05---leads to a vicious cycle of overoptimistic expectation of the replicability of results.
First, we show analytically that when true statistical power is relatively low, computing power based on statistically significant results will lead to overestimates of power. Then, we present a case study using 10 experimental comparisons drawn from a recently published meta-analysis in psycholinguistics (J\"ager et al., 2017). We show that the statistically significant results yield an illusion of replicability.  This illusion holds even if the researcher doesn't conduct any formal power analysis but just uses statistical significance to informally assess robustness (i.e., replicability) of results.},

  title = {Type M error in practice: A case study},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of the ISBA World Meeting},
  address = {Edinburgh, UK},
  abstract = {Treating a result as newsworthy, i.e., publishable, because the p-value is less than 0.05 leads to overoptimistic expectations of replicability. The underlying cause of these overoptimistic expectations is Type M(agnitude) error (Gelman & Carlin, 2014): when underpowered studies yield significant results, the effect size estimates are invariably exaggerated and noisy. Here, we demonstrate the adverse consequences of this statistical significance filter. We do this by carrying out direct replication attempts of published results from a recent paper. Six experiments (self-paced reading and eyetracking, 168 participants in total) show that the published (statistically significant) claims are so noisy that even non-significant results are fully compatible with them. We also demonstrate the stark contrast between these small-sample studies and a larger-sample study (100 participants); the latter yields much less noisy estimates but also a much smaller magnitude of the effect of interest. The small magnitude looks less compelling but is more realistic. We suggest that researchers (i) move their focus away from statistical significance, (ii) attend instead to the precision of their estimates, and (iii) carry out direct replications in order to demonstrate the existence of an effect.},

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00564},
  abstract = {We present a case-study demonstrating the usefulness of Bayesian hierarchical mixture modelling for investigating cognitive processes. In sentence comprehension, it is widely assumed that the distance between linguistic co-dependents affects the latency of dependency resolution: the longer the distance, the longer the retrieval time (the distance-based account). An alternative theory, direct-access, assumes that retrieval times are a mixture of two distributions: one distribution represents successful retrievals (these are independent of dependency distance) and the other represents an initial failure to retrieve the correct dependent, followed by a reanalysis that leads to successful retrieval. We implement both models as Bayesian hierarchical models and show that the direct-access model explains Chinese relative clause reading time data better than the distance account.},

  title = {Feature overwriting as a finite mixture process: {E}vidence from comprehension data},
  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04081},
  abstract = {The ungrammatical sentence "The key to the cabinets are on the table" is known to lead to an illusion of grammaticality. As discussed in the meta-analysis by Jaeger et al., 2017, faster reading times are observed at the verb are in the agreement-attraction sentence above compared to the equally ungrammatical sentence "The key to the cabinet are on the table". One explanation for this facilitation effect is the feature percolation account: the plural feature on cabinets percolates up to the head noun key, leading to the illusion. An alternative account is in terms of cue-based retrieval (Lewis & Vasishth, 2005), which assumes that the non-subject noun cabinets is misretrieved due to a partial feature-match when a dependency completion process at the auxiliary initiates a memory access for a subject with plural marking. We present evidence for yet another explanation for the observed facilitation. Because the second sentence has two nouns with identical number, it is possible that these are, in some proportion of trials, more difficult to keep distinct, leading to slower reading times at the verb in the first sentence above; this is the feature overwriting account of Nairne, 1990. We show that the feature overwriting proposal can be implemented as a finite mixture process. We reanalysed ten published data-sets, fitting hierarchical Bayesian mixture models to these data assuming a two-mixture distribution. We show that in nine out of the ten studies, a mixture distribution corresponding to feature overwriting furnishes a superior fit over both the feature percolation and the cue-based retrieval accounts.},
