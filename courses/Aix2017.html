# Tutorial 1: Introduction to foundations of frequentist statistics Part 1 (24 Oct 2017, Room A003)

I will introduce the foundations of frequentist reasoning: the sampling distribution of the sample mean, Type I, II and Type M,S errors, and simple t-tests. 

## Background reading:

+ The contents are available as slides (from the SMLP 2017 summer school at Potsdam): http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/smlp2017materials/01.zip 

+ These slides are also available as lecture notes: https://github.com/vasishth/Statistics-lecture-notes-Potsdam/blob/master/IntroductoryStatistics/StatisticsNotesVasishth.pdf

#  Tutorial 2: Introduction to foundations of frequentist statistics Part 2 (26 Oct 2017, Room B011)

Cancelled due to illness. 


# Tutorial 3: Intro to Linear Mixed Models, some advanced issues related to linear mixed models: model specification, and Bayesian LMMs (31 Oct 2017, Room A003)

Here, I will go through some of the issues surrounding model selection and also talk about Bayesian hierarchical modeling using Stan.
