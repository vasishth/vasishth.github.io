  Abstract                 = {The response-signal speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) procedure was used to investigate the relationship between measures of working memory capacity and the time course of short-term item recognition. High- and low-span participants studied sequentially presented 6-item lists, immediately followed by a recognition probe. Analyses of composite list and serial position SAT functions found no differences in retrieval speed between the 2 span groups. Overall accuracy was higher for high spans than low spans, with more pronounced differences for earlier serial positions. Analysis of false alarms to recent negatives (lures from the previous study list) revealed no differences in the timing or magnitude of early false alarms, thought to reflect familiarity-based judgments. However, analyses of false alarms later in retrieval indicated that recollective information accrues more slowly for low spans, which suggests that recollective information may also contribute less to judgments concerning studied items for low-span participants. These findings can provide an explanation for the greater susceptibility of low spans to interference.},

  Abstract                 = {Participants' eye movements were recorded as they inspected a semi-realistic visual scene showing a boy, a cake, and various distractor objects. Whilst viewing this scene, they heard sentences such as 'the boy will move the cake' or 'the boy will eat the cake'. The cake was the only edible object portrayed in the scene. In each of two experiments, the onset of saccadic eye movements to the target object (the cake) was significantly later in the move condition than in the eat condition; saccades to the target were launched after the onset of the spoken word cake in the move condition, but before its onset in the eat condition. The results suggest that information at the verb can be used to restrict the domain within the context to which subsequent reference will be made by the (as yet unencountered) post-verbal grammatical object. The data support a hypothesis in which sentence processing is driven by the predictive relationships between verbs, their syntactic arguments, and the real-world contexts in which they occur.},

  Abstract                 = {Adaptive control of thought-rational (ACT-R; J. R. Anderson \& C. Lebiere, 1998) has evolved into a theory that consists of multiple modules but also explains how these modules are integrated to produce coherent cognition. The perceptual-motor modules, the goal module, and the declarative memory module are presented as examples of specialized systems in ACT-R. These modules are associated with distinct cortical regions. These modules place chunks in buffers where they can be detected by a production system that responds to patterns of information in the buffers. At any point in time, a single production rule is selected to respond to the current pattern. Subsymbolic processes serve to guide the selection of rules to fire as well as the internal operations of some modules. Much of learning involves tuning of these subsymbolic processes. A number of simple and complex empirical examples are described to illustrate how these modules function singly and in concert.},
  Annote                   = {* modules: 1. a visual module for identifying objects in the visual field, 2. manual module for controlling the hands, a declarative 3. module for retrieving information from memory, and a 4. goal module for keeping track of current goals and intentions Coordination in the behavior of these modules is achieved through a central production system. This central production system is not sensitive to most of the activity of these modules but rather can only respond to a limited amount of information that is deposited in the buffers of these modules. -the information in these modules is largely encapsulated, and the modules communicate only through the information they make available in their buffers. - The buffers of these modules hold the limited information that the production system can respond to. They * The core produc- tion system can recognize patterns in these buffers and make changes to these buffers, * production rules represent ACT–R’s procedural memory An important function of the production rules is to update the buffers in the ACT–R architecture. * Thus, the critical cycle in ACT–R is one in which the buffers hold repre- sentations determined by the external world and internal modules, patterns in these buffers are recognized, a production fires, and the buffers are then updated for another cycle. (The assumption in ACT–R is that this cycle takes about 50 ms to complete) * The conditions of the production rule specify a pattern of activity in the buffers that the rule will match, and the action specifies changes to be made to buffers. * mixture of parallel and serial processing: -Within each module, there is a great deal of parallelism Also, the processes within different modules can go on in parallel and asynchronously. However, there are also two levels of serial bottlenecks in the system. i), the content of any buffer is limited to a single declarative unit of knowledge, called a chunk in ACT–R. Thus, only a single memory can be retrieved at a time or only a single object can be encoded from the visual field. ii) only a single production is selected at each cycle to fire The ACT–R visual system: i) A visual-location module and buffer represent the dorsal where system ii) a visual-object module and buffer represent the ventral what system. When a production makes a request of the where system: the production specifies a series of constraints, and the where system returns a chunk representing a location meeting those constraints. Constraints are attribute–value pairs that can restrict the search based on visual properties of the object (such as “color: red”).Through the where system, ACT–R has knowledge of where allthe objects are. to identify an object, it must make a request of the what system: A request will cause the what system to shift visual attention to that location, process the object located there, and generate a declarative memory chunk represent- ing the object. Modules: * Goal Module cognitive core of ACT–R: * The declarative memory system * the procedural system , the activation of achunk is a sum of a base-level activation, reflecting its general usefulness in the past, and an associative activation, reflecting its relevance to the current context.},

  Abstract                 = {The Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) test involves rapidly naming sequences of items presented in a visual array. RAN has generated considerable interest because RAN performance predicts reading achievement. This study sought to determine what elements of RAN are responsible for the shared variance between RAN and reading performance using a series of cognitive tasks and a latent variable modelling approach. Participants performed RAN measures, a test of reading speed and comprehension, and six tasks, which tapped various hypothesised components of the RAN. RAN shared 10\% of the variance with reading comprehension and 17\% with reading rate. Together, the decomposition tasks explained 52\% and 39\% of the variance shared between RAN and reading comprehension and between RAN and reading rate, respectively. Significant predictors suggested that working memory encoding underlies part of the relationship between RAN and reading ability.},

Effective strategy use on WM span tasks accounted for variance in the span-memory relationship, but not for the span-comprehension relationship, supporting the strategy affordance hypothesis.

  Abstract                 = {Based on accumulating evidence, simulation appears to be a basic computational mechanism in the brain that supports a broad spectrum of processes from perception to social cognition. Further evidence suggests that simulation is typically situated, with the situated character of experience in the environment being reflected in the situated character of the representations that underlie simulation. A basic architecture is sketched of how the brain implements situated simulation. Within this framework, simulators implement the concepts that underlie knowledge, and situated conceptualizations capture patterns of multi-modal simulation associated with frequently experienced situations. A pattern completion inference mechanism uses current perception to activate situated conceptualizations that produce predictions via simulations on relevant modalities. Empirical findings from perception, action, working memory, conceptual processing, language and social cognition illustrate how this framework produces the extensive prediction that characterizes natural intelligence.},

  Abstract                 = {Is forgetting in the short term due to decay with the mere passage of time, interference from other memoranda, or both? Past research on short-term memory has revealed some evidence for decay and a plethora of evidence showing that short-term memory is worsened by interference. However, none of these studies has directly contrasted decay and interference in short-term memory in a task that rules out the use of rehearsal processes. In this article the authors present a series of studies using a novel paradigm to address this problem directly, by interrogating the operation of decay and interference in short-term memory without rehearsal confounds. The results of these studies indicate that short-term memories are subject to very small decay effects with the mere passage of time but that interference plays a much larger role in their degradation. The authors discuss the implications of these results for existing models of memory decay and interference.},

Event-related brain potentials revealed that dative-marked objects in the initial position of an embedded sentence do not elicit a neurophysiologically distinct response from subjects, whereas accusative-marked objects do. These differences are predictable on the basis of grammatical distinctions (i.e. underlying linguistic properties), but not on the basis of frequency information (i.e. a superficial linguistic property). We therefore conclude that the former, but not the latter, guides syntactic integration during online parsing.},

  abstract = {The surprisal of a word on a probabilistic grammar constitutes a promising
  complexity metric for human sentence comprehension difficulty. Using two
  different grammar types, surprisal is shown to have an effect on fixation durations
  and regression probabilities in a sample of German readers' eye movements, the
  Potsdam Sentence Corpus. A linear mixed-effects model was used to quantify the
  effect of surprisal while taking into account unigram frequency and bigram frequency
  (transitional probability), word length, and empirically-derived word predictability;
  the so-called ‚``early'' and ``late'' measures of processing difficulty both showed
  an effect of surprisal. Surprisal is also shown to have a small but statistically
  non-significant effect on empirically-derived predictability itself. This work thus
  demonstrates the importance of including parsing costs as a predictor of comprehension
  difficulty in models of reading, and suggests that a simple identification
  of syntactic parsing costs with early measures and late measures with durations of
  post-syntactic events may be difficult to uphold.},

Surprisal models all fixation measures and regressionprobability. By contrast, retrieval does not model any measure in serialprocessing. As more candidate analyses are considered in parallel at each word,retrieval can account for the same measures as surprisal. This pattern suggests animportant role for ranked parallelism in theories of sentence comprehension.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this study was to determine whether variability in working memory (WM) capacity and cognitive control affects the processing of global discourse congruence and local associations among words when participants listened to short discourse passages. The final, critical word of each passage was either associated or unassociated with a preceding prime word (e.g., "He was not prepared for the fame and fortune/praise"). These critical words were also either congruent or incongruent with respect to the preceding discourse context [e.g., a context in which a prestigious prize was won (congruent) or in which the protagonist had been arrested (incongruent)]. We used multiple regression to assess the unique contribution of suppression ability (our measure of cognitive control) and WM capacity on the amplitude of individual N400 effects of congruence and association. Our measure of suppression ability did not predict the size of the N400 effects of association or congruence. However, as expected, the results showed that high WM capacity individuals were less sensitive to the presence of lexical associations (showed smaller N400 association effects). Furthermore, differences in WM capacity were related to differences in the topographic distribution of the N400 effects of discourse congruence. The topographic differences in the global congruence effects indicate differences in the underlying neural generators of the N400 effects, as a function of WM. This suggests additional, or at a minimum, distinct, processing on the part of higher capacity individuals when tasked with integrating incoming words into the developing discourse representation.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study was to investigate individual differences in the influence of lexical association on word recognition during auditory sentence processing. Lexical associations among individual words (e.g. salt and pepper) represent one type of semantic information that is available during the processing of words in context. We predicted that individuals would vary in their sensitivity to this type of local context as a function of suppression ability and working-memory capacity. Lexical association was manipulated in auditory sentence contexts, and multiple regression analyses were employed to examine the relation between individuals' brain responses to meaning relations in sentences and measures of working-memory capacity, cognitive control and vocabulary. Lexical association influenced the processing of words that were embedded in sentences and also showed a great deal of individual variability. Specifically, suppression ability emerged as a significant predictor of sensitivity to lexical association, such that individuals who performed poorly on our measure of suppression ability (the Stroop task), compared to those who performed well, showed larger N400 effects of lexical association.},

  Abstract                 = {The relationship between interference and facilitation effects in the Stroop task is poorly understood yet central to its implications. At question is the modal view that they arise from a single mechanism-the congruency of color and word. Two developments have challenged that view: (a) the belief that facilitation effects are fractionally small compared with interference effects, or nonexistent altogether; and (b) the finding that interference and facilitation effects are inversely correlated. Statistical simulations, reanalysis of past data, and two new experiments indicate that facilitation is robust and substantial when congruency is deconfounded from lexicality, and that the inverse correlations are mostly spurious. Instead, interference and facilitation are uncorrelated, or at most weakly but inversely related. Resolution of response conflict and lexical convergence can explain either finding. Modeling and interpretation of the Stroop task must distinguish between nonspecific lexicality-based effects and specific color-word congruency effects.},

  Abstract                 = {In this Perspective Article we assess the usefulness of Google's new word frequencies for word recognition research (lexical decision and word naming). We find that, despite the massive corpus on which the Google estimates are based (131 billion words from books published in the United States alone), the Google American English frequencies explain 11\% less of the variance in the lexical decision times from the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007) than the SUBTLEX-US word frequencies, based on a corpus of 51 million words from film and television subtitles. Further analyses indicate that word frequencies derived from recent books (published after 2000) are better predictors of word processing times than frequencies based on the full corpus, and that word frequencies based on fiction books predict word processing times better than word frequencies based on the full corpus. The most predictive word frequencies from Google still do not explain more of the variance in word recognition times of undergraduate students and old adults than the subtitle-based word frequencies.},

  Abstract                 = {This target article discusses the verbal working memory system used in sentence comprehension. We review the concept of working memory as a short-duration system in which small amounts of information are simultaneously stored and manipulated in the service of accomplishing a task. We summarize the argument that syntactic processing in sentence comprehension requires such a storage and computational system. We then ask whether the working memory system used in syntactic processing is the same as that used in verbally mediated tasks that involve conscious controlled processing. Evidence is brought to bear from various sources: the relationship between individual differences in working memory and individual differences in the efficiency of syntactic processing; the effect of concurrent verbal memory load on syntactic processing; and syntactic processing in patients with poor short-term memory, patients with poor working memory, and patients with aphasia. Experimental results from these normal subjects and patients with various brain lesions converge on the conclusion that there is a specialization in the verbal working memory system for assigning the syntactic structure of a sentence and using that structure in determining sentence meaning that is separate from the working memory system underlying the use of sentence meaning to accomplish other functions. We present a theory of the divisions of the verbal working memory system and suggestions regarding its neural basis.},

The test consists of six forms, each comprising 25 high-predictability (HP) sentences and 25 low-predictability (LP) sentences. The sentences were used in a perceptual task to assess their intelligibility in babble noise across three different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions in a sample of 474 normal-hearing listeners. The results showed that the listeners obtained higher scores of intelligibility for HP sentences than for LP sentences, and the scores were lower for the higher SNRs, as was expected. The final six forms were equivalent in intelligibility and phonetic content.},

  Abstract                 = {Probabilistic methods are providing new explanatory approaches to fundamental cognitive science questions of how humans structure, process and acquire language. This review examines probabilistic models defined over traditional symbolic structures. Language comprehension and production involve probabilistic inference in such models; and acquisition involves choosing the best model, given innate constraints and linguistic and other input. Probabilistic models can account for the learning and processing of language, while maintaining the sophistication of symbolic models. A recent burgeoning of theoretical developments and online corpus creation has enabled large models to be tested, revealing probabilistic constraints in processing, undermining acquisition arguments based on a perceived poverty of the stimulus, and suggesting fruitful links with probabilistic theories of categorization and ambiguity resolution in perception.},

  Abstract                 = {Working memory (WM) span tasks—and in particular, counting span, operation span, and reading span tasks—are widely used measures of WM capacity. Despite their popularity, however, there has never been a comprehensive analysis of the merits of WM span tasks as measurement tools. Here, we review the genesis of these tasks and discuss how and why they came to be so influential. In so doing, we address the reliability and validity of the tasks, and we consider more technical aspects of the tasks, such as optimal administration and scoring procedures. Finally, we discuss statistical and methodological techniques that have commonly been used in conjunction with WM span tasks, such as latent variable analysis and extreme-groups designs.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have established a relation between ongoing brain activity fluctuations and intertrial variability in evoked neural responses, perception, and motor performance. Here, we extended these investigations into the domain of cognitive control. Using functional neuroimaging and a sparse event-related design (with long and unpredictable intervals), we measured ongoing activity fluctuations and evoked responses in volunteers performing a Stroop task with color-word interference. Across trials, prestimulus activity of several regions predicted subsequent response speed and across subjects this effect scaled with the Stroop effect size, being significant only in subjects manifesting behavioral interference. These effects occurred only in task relevant as the dorsal anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as ventral visual areas sensitive to color and visual words. Crucially, in subjects showing a Stroop effect, reaction times were faster when prestimulus activity was higher in task-relevant (color) regions and slower when activity was higher in irrelevant (word form) regions. These findings suggest that intrinsic brain activity fluctuations modulate neural mechanisms underpinning selective voluntary attention and cognitive control. Rephrased in terms of predictive coding models, ongoing activity can hence be considered a proxy of the precision (gain) with which prediction error signals are transmitted upon sensory stimulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Stroop effects might be due to differences in stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) and/or to differences in stimulus-stimulus compatibility (SSC). Recent evidence for the role of SSC is inconclusive, because there were no controls for effects of SRC that are based on short-term associations between stimuli and responses (i.e., associations set up as the result of task instructions). In two experiments, SRC effects were controlled for. Regardless of whether the irrelevant and the relevant stimulus features were separated (Experiment 1) or integrated in one stimulus (Experiment 2), the results revealed an effect of SSC and an effect of SRC that was based on short-term associations. The results thus confirm that both processes at the level of encoding and processes at the level of response selection contribute to the Stroop effect.},

Here we report an additional finding from that study: a prolonged ERP frontal positivity to less probable noun continuations. We suggest that this positivity is consistent with hypotheses that additional neural processing may be invoked when highly expected continuations are not encountered in the input and speculate briefly on possible functional correlates.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the numerous examples of anticipatory cognitive processes at micro and macro levels in many animal species, the idea that anticipation of specific words plays an integral role in real-time language processing has been contentious. Here we exploited a phonological regularity of English indefinite articles ('an' precedes nouns beginning with vowel sounds, whereas 'a' precedes nouns beginning with consonant sounds) in combination with event-related brain potential recordings from the human scalp to show that readers' brains can pre-activate individual words in a graded fashion to a degree that can be estimated from the probability that each word is given as a continuation for a sentence fragment offline. These findings are evidence that readers use the words in a sentence (as cues to their world knowledge) to estimate relative likelihoods for upcoming words.},

  Abstract                 = {We evaluate the predictions of two theories of syntactic processing complexity, dependency locality theory (DLT) and surprisal, against the Dundee Corpus, which contains the eye-tracking record of 10 participants reading 51,000 words of newspaper text. Our results show that DLT integration cost is not a significant predictor of reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. However, DLT successfully predicts reading times for nouns. We also find evidence for integration cost effects at auxiliaries, not predicted by DLT. For surprisal, we demonstrate that an unlexicalized formulation of surprisal can predict reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. Comparing DLT integration cost and surprisal, we find that the two measures are uncorrelated, which suggests that a complete theory will need to incorporate both aspects of processing complexity. We conclude that eye-tracking corpora, which provide reading time data for naturally occurring, contextualized sentences, can complement experimental evidence as a basis for theories of processing complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {There is growing evidence that a specific region in the posterior frontolateral cortex is involved intimately in cognitive control processes. This region, located in the vicinity of the junction of the inferior frontal sulcus and the inferior precentral sulcus, was termed the inferior frontal junction (IFJ). The IFJ was shown to be involved in the updating of task representations and to be activated commonly in a within-subject investigation of a task-switching paradigm, the Stroop task, and a verbal n-back task. Here, we investigate the involvement of the IFJ in cognitive control by employing a meta-analytic approach. Two quantitative meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies were conducted. One meta-analysis included frontal activations from task-switching, set-shifting, and stimulus-response (S-R) reversal studies, the other included frontal activations from color-word Stroop studies. Results showed highly significant clustering of activations in the IFJ in both analyses. These results provide strong evidence for the consistent involvement of the IFJ in both switching and Stroop paradigms. Furthermore, they support our concept of areal specialization in the frontolateral cortex, which posits that it is not only the middorsolateral part that plays an important role in cognitive control, but also the IFJ. Finally, our results demonstrate how quantitative meta-analyses can be used to test hypotheses about the involvement of specific brain regions in cognitive control.},

- strategy reports significantly predicted OSPAN scores, such that trials on which participants reported using a normatively effective strategy yielded higher recall than did trials on which participants reported using a normatively ineffective strategy exp. 2 - replicate findings and to allow more complete evaluation of strategy mediation hypothesis - concurrent set-by-set reports were dropped in favour of retrospective reports - to investigate whether strategy use can account for any span-- ability relationships, each participant also com- pleted three standard measures of cognitive (verbal) ability, which included tests of analogical reasoning and reading comprehension. - Verbal Analogies, Reading Comprehension, and Inference); the first two were modified from the originals by presenting only a subset of items - The major meth- odological change was that all set-by-set reports were made retrospectively. - set-by-set reports had construct validity, accounted for varia- bility in span performance, and were more highly related to span performance than were general reports - 24\% only rehearsal/reading, 71\% at least one effective strategy - although individ- uals were strategic in some cases, widespread use of effective strategies was not evident, with over 50\% of the participants using them on fewer than a third of the trials. - The proportion correct on the span task was significantly greater for normatively effective strategies (M 1⁄4 .70, Mdn 1⁄4 .73, SEM 1⁄4 .03) than for the normatively less effective strategies (M 1⁄4 .61, Mdn 1⁄4 .62, SEM 1⁄4 .02), t(67) 1⁄4 2.90, p , .05. - several diverse sources of evidence demonstrate the empirical validity of the strategy-as-effect account Across two experiments, individual differences in effective strategy use were evident. As important, these differences sig- nificantly correlated with performance on the span task. These outcomes confirm a critical prediction of the strategy mediation hypothesis. Turley-Ames and Whitfield (2003) found that high-WM participants benefited little when instructed to use rehearsal, imagery, or semantic-chaining strategies during OSPAN, because they appeared to have been performing optimally in the pretest, prior to any instruction. individual differences in WM capacity may afford the use of strategies, which in turn can contribute to span scores},

  Abstract                 = {Visual cortex is traditionally viewed as a hierarchy of neural feature detectors, with neural population responses being driven by bottom-up stimulus features. Conversely, "predictive coding" models propose that each stage of the visual hierarchy harbors two computationally distinct classes of processing unit: representational units that encode the conditional probability of a stimulus and provide predictions to the next lower level; and error units that encode the mismatch between predictions and bottom-up evidence, and forward prediction error to the next higher level. Predictive coding therefore suggests that neural population responses in category-selective visual regions, like the fusiform face area (FFA), reflect a summation of activity related to prediction ("face expectation") and prediction error ("face surprise"), rather than a homogenous feature detection response. We tested the rival hypotheses of the feature detection and predictive coding models by collecting functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the FFA while independently varying both stimulus features (faces vs houses) and subjects' perceptual expectations regarding those features (low vs medium vs high face expectation). The effects of stimulus and expectation factors interacted, whereby FFA activity elicited by face and house stimuli was indistinguishable under high face expectation and maximally differentiated under low face expectation. Using computational modeling, we show that these data can be explained by predictive coding but not by feature detection models, even when the latter are augmented with attentional mechanisms. Thus, population responses in the ventral visual stream appear to be determined by feature expectation and surprise rather than by stimulus features per se.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent findings indicate that, in humans, the hippocampal memory system is involved in the capacity to imagine the future as well as remember the past. Other studies have suggested that animals may also have the capacity to recall the past and plan for the future. Here, we will consider data that bridge between these sets of findings by assessing the role of the hippocampus in memory and prediction in rats. We will argue that animals have the capacity for recollection and that the hippocampus plays a central and selective role in binding information in the service of recollective memory. Then we will consider examples of transitive inference, a paradigm that requires the integration of overlapping memories and flexible use of the resulting relational memory networks for generating predictions in novel situations. Our data show that animals have the capacity for transitive inference and that the hippocampus plays a central role in the ability to predict outcomes of events that have not yet occurred.},

  Abstract                 = {Linguistic dependencies between non-adjacent words have been shown to cause comprehension difficulty, compared with local dependencies. According to one class of sentence comprehension accounts, non-local dependencies are difficult because they require the retrieval of the first dependent from memory when the second dependent is encountered. According to these memory-based accounts, making the first dependent accessible at the time when the second dependent is encountered should help alleviate the difficulty associated with the processing of non-local dependencies. In a dual-task paradigm, participants read sentences that did or did not contain a non-local dependency (i.e., object- and subject-extracted cleft constructions) while simultaneously remembering a word. The memory task was aimed at making the word held in memory accessible throughout the sentence. In an object-extracted cleft (e.g., It was Ellen whom John consulted\ldots), the object (Ellen) must be retrieved from memory when consulted is encountered. In the critical manipulation, the memory word was identical to the verb's object (ELLEN). In these conditions, the extraction effect was reduced in the comprehension accuracy data and eliminated in the reading time data. These results add to the body of evidence supporting memory-based accounts of syntactic complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during the processing of unambiguous German sentences containing different types of filler-gap dependency. Both topicalization constructions and wh-questions were found to elicit a left-anterior negativity (LAN) prior to the processing of the subcategorizing verb, relative to a gap-free control condition. At the subcategorizing verb, sentences containing a wh-dependency produced a parietal positivity (P600) relative to topicalization structures. These results support the claim that separable parsing processes are involved in the processing of syntactic dependencies, with working memory based processes being reflected in an LAN, and the relative difficulty of integrating the filler with its subcategorizer reflected in a P600. Integration cost but not memory cost was found to be influenced by the type of filler-gap dependency involved.},

Ferreira (2003) had college students listen to sentences such as the dog was bitten by the man. Afterwards, they were asked to name the agent of the action. Surprisingly, a large proportion of the participants gave the wrong answer, even though the sentence was presented clearly and there was little time pressure to respond. It thus appears that although the comprehension system clearly makes use of syntactic algorithms, it also uses heuristics which generally operate more quickly (Townsend \& Bever 2001). The heuristic interpretation might then be selected because it becomes available more quickly, or because the system has some reason for preferring it (e.g., it conforms to real world knowledge).

In the context of wh-movement, such a memory component is necessary for establishing filler-gap dependencies. The data obtained from the fMRI experiment will be used to discuss the results of previous neuroimaging studies of sentence processing.

  Abstract                 = {Most previous neuroimaging studies of sentence processing have associated Broca's area with syntactic processing; however, the exact nature of the processes subserved by this brain region is yet not well understood. Although some authors suggest that Brodmann area (BA) 44 of the left inferior frontal gyrus (i.e., Broca's area) is relevant for syntactic integration processes, others claim that it is associated with working memory mechanisms relevant for language processing. To dissociate these two possible functions, the present study investigated hemodynamic responses elicited while participants processed German indirect wh-questions. Activation increases were observed in left BA 44 together with superior temporal areas and right hemispheric homologues for sentences with noncanonical word order, in which a verb argument was dislocated from its canonical position over a relatively long distance. In these sentences, syntactic working memory load was assumed to be greatest. In contrast, no activation increase was elicited by object-initial as opposed to subject-initial sentences that did not differ with respect to working memory costs but with respect to syntactic integration costs. These data strongly suggest that Broca's area plays a critical role in syntactic working memory during online sentence comprehension.},

One is that the slower, or interpreting the expression is slower, or both. The other is that the of processing is actually slower: retrieving a constituent is of processing is degraded: retrieving the desired constituent may incur errors (e.g., failure to retrieve essential information, misanalyses of grammatical relations), and/or the quality of the resulting interpretation is lesser (e.g., acceptability, plausibility, specificity). Crucially, common timing measures will be slower or later if there is decreased accuracy – even if all component operations required for interpreting each expression complete at comparable speeds (McElree and Nordlie 1999). (McElree and Nordlie 1999). (see MacDonald and Christiansen 2002). addition, in recent fMRI studies (\"{O}ztekin et al. 2008, 2010), conditions that engendered a fast SAT speed were associated with less activity in the hippocampus, Based on the “container” conception of working memory, comprehension errors or failures have been routinely attributed to overtaxing a limited working memory capacity when storing or manipulating the products of recent analyses (e.g., Caplan and Waters 1999; In contrast, for direct access, retrieval time is unaffected by increasing the number of distractors, since the retrieval process occurs only for the desired item that matches the cues. interpret this strategy to involve active maintenance of the filler element as long as the dependency remains unresolved. The strategy's critical aspect that we tested is whether proactive prediction rather than reactive retrieval is a psychologically plausible operation during comprehension . is the reading advantage due to active maintenance (faster speed) or direct-access retrieval (higher accuracy)? its possible to complete the dep after each verb. then lower acc can be because of a garden path Jointly, intercept and rate measure of the speed of processing, indexing how quickly accuracy accrues to its asymptotic level. linguistic expressions may differ in processing time for two independent reasons. More compelling evidence would consist of demonstrations that the memory operations in comprehension also recruit the same brain regions as those outside the language domain (e.g., \"{O}ztekin et al. 2008, 2010), Results indicated that subject NPs can be maintained in focal attention concurrently with either a modifying prepositional phrase (23) or an adverb (26), exhibiting the same time-course (intercept, rate) as the bare NP in (22). sensitivity to recency (distance) is in fact a rational property of a memory system (Anderson 1990). the book is retrieved at the end all the time. right before ripped The signals can be distributed across trials with one deadline per trial (single-response SAT), or they can all occur on each trial (multiple-response SAT). This experiment used the single-response SAT procedure: on each trial, participants read a sentence word-by-word (i.e., rapid serial visual presentation) and entered an un/acceptable button press judgment for one of six response-signals ranging from 50 to 3000 ms after the onset of the final verb. three memory operations proposed for resolving this and other types of non-adjacent dependencies: serial search retrieval, in which the dependent constituent is recovered by a search process through representations in memory, direct-access retrieval in which the dependent constituent is recovered directly by retrieval cue operations without search, and active maintenance of the dependent constituent in focal attention. What is required is a method that provides conjoint measures of speed and accuracy, enabling researchers to tease apart the contributions of the speed},

  Abstract                 = {The entropy-reduction hypothesis claims that the cognitive processing difficulty on a word in sentence context is determined by the word's effect on the uncertainty about the sentence. Here, this hypothesis is tested more thoroughly than has been done before, using a recurrent neural network for estimating entropy and self-paced reading for obtaining measures of cognitive processing load. Results show a positive relation between reading time on a word and the reduction in entropy due to processing that word, supporting the entropy-reduction hypothesis. Although this effect is independent from the effect of word surprisal, we find no evidence that these two measures correspond to cognitively distinct processes.},

Two questionnaires and an on-line reading study showed that readers prefer a d-linked phrase more than a non-d-linked phrase as the antecedent for a pronoun, suggesting that d-linked phrases are immediately instantiated in a discourse representation that is checked during the process of pronoun interpretation. Comparable difficulty is not observed for non-d-linked interrogatives. A questionnaire and an on-line listening study also showed that readers and listeners were more willing to accept a grammatical "island violation" containing a pronoun when the pronoun's antecedent was a d-linked interrogative than when the antecedent was non-d-linked, suggesting that they check a discourse representation for the pronoun antecedent. All results suggest that d-linked phrases are immediately interpreted in a discourse representation, not just in a syntactic representation.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a new theory of the relationship between the sentence processing mechanism and the available computational resources. This theory--the Syntactic Prediction Locality Theory (SPLT)--has two components: an integration cost component and a component for the memory cost associated with keeping track of obligatory syntactic requirements. Memory cost is hypothesized to be quantified in terms of the number of syntactic categories that are necessary to complete the current input string as a grammatical sentence. Furthermore, in accordance with results from the working memory literature both memory cost and integration cost are hypothesized to be heavily influenced by locality (1) the longer a predicted category must be kept in memory before the prediction is satisfied, the greater is the cost for maintaining that prediction; and (2) the greater the distance between an incoming word and the most local head or dependent to which it attaches, the greater the integration cost. The SPLT is shown to explain a wide range of processing complexity phenomena not previously accounted for under a single theory, including (1) the lower complexity of subject-extracted relative clauses compared to object-extracted relative clauses, (2) numerous processing overload effects across languages, including the unacceptability of multiply center-embedded structures, (3) the lower complexity of cross-serial dependencies relative to center-embedded dependencies, (4) heaviness effects, such that sentences are easier to understand when larger phrases are placed later and (5) numerous ambiguity effects, such as those which have been argued to be evidence for the Active Filler Hypothesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Participants remembered a short set of words while reading syntactically complex sentences (object-extracted clefts) and syntactically simpler sentences (subject-extracted clefts) in a memory-load study. The study also manipulated whether the words in the set and the words in the sentence were of matched or unmatched types (common nouns vs. proper names). Performance in sentence comprehension was worse for complex sentences than for simpler sentences, and this effect was greater when the type of words in the memory load matched the type of words in the sentence. These results indicate that syntactic processing is not modular, instead suggesting that it relies on working memory resources that are used for other nonsyntactic processes. Further, the results indicate that similarity-based interference is an important constraint on information processing that can be overcome to some degree during language comprehension by using the coherence of language to construct integrated representations of meaning.},

These loads can be efficiently calculated using a probabilistic Earley parser (Stolcke,1995) which is interpreted as generating predictionsabout reading time on a word-by-word basis.

  Abstract                 = {If subjects are required to name the color of the word red printed in blue ink, interference between word meaning and ink color occurs, which slows down reaction time. This effect is well known as the Stroop effect. It is still an unresolved issue how the brain deals with interference in this type of task. To explore this question, an electroencephalogram (EEG) study was carried out. By analyzing several measures of EEG activity, two main findings emerged. First, the event-related potential (ERP) showed increased fronto-central negativity in a time window around 400 msec for incongruent items in contrast to congruent and neutral items. Source localization analysis revealed that a source in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) contributed most to the difference. Second, time-frequency analysis showed that theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) in the ACC increased linearly with increasing interference and that phase coupling between the ACC and the left prefrontal cortex was longer persistent for incongruent items compared to congruent and neutral items. These effects occurred at a time window around 600 msec. We conclude that interference between color naming and word meaning in the Stroop task manifests itself at around 400 msec and mainly activates the ACC. Thereafter, sustained phase coupling between the ACC and the prefrontal cortex occurs, which most likely reflects the engagement of cognitive control mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {An unresolved issue in the study of sentence comprehension is whether the process of gap-filling is mediated by the construction of empty categories (traces), or whether the parser relates fillers directly to the associated verb's argument structure. We conducted an event-related potentials (ERP) study that used the violation paradigm to examine the time course and spatial distribution of brain responses to ungrammatically filled gaps. The results indicate that the earliest brain response to the violation is an early left anterior negativity (eLAN). This ERP indexes an early phase of pure syntactic structure building, temporally preceding ERPs that reflect semantic integration and argument structure satisfaction. The finding is interpreted as evidence that gap-filling is mediated by structurally predicted empty categories, rather than directly by argument structure operations.},

  Abstract                 = {Population-based studies indicate dual routes to disabled reading in adolescence and adulthood: slowed acquisition of single word reading and ADHD (particularly inattention) in early childhood. Impairments in rapid serial naming may be a factor common to both problems. The gold-standard measure of this ability, the Rapid Automatized Naming Task (RAN; [Denckla MB, Rudel R. Rapid automatized naming of pictured objects, colors, letters and numbers by normal children. Cortex 1974;10:186-202]), has traditionally been administered in a paper-pencil format. Recently however, researchers [Neuhaus GF, Carlson CD, Jeng WM, Post Y, Swank PR. The reliability and validity of rapid automatized scoring software ratings for the determination of pause and articulation component durations. Educ Psychol Meas 2001;61:490-504] have begun to use computerized versions of the RAN. Here a slightly modified computerized version of the RAN was created and the equivalency between the computerized RAN and the conventional version was investigated using a university student sample. Naming times on the conventional and computerized RAN were highly correlated, overall, and for each of the four RAN stimulus types (letters, digit, colors, objects). Conventional and computerized RAN times predicted reading rate and reading comprehension scores equally well and both showed very high test-retest reliability. With our university student sample, findings indicate equivalency between the two testing mediums in all areas examined.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports results from a self-paced reading study in Chinese that demonstrates that object-extracted relative clause structures are less complex than corresponding subject-extracted structures. These results contrast with results from processing other Subject-Verb-Object languages like English, in which object-extracted structures are more complex than subject-extracted structures. A key word-order difference between Chinese and other Subject-Verb-Object languages is that Chinese relative clauses precede their head nouns. Because of this word order difference, the results follow from a resource-based theory of sentence complexity, according to which there is a storage cost associated with predicting syntactic heads in order to form a grammatical sentence. The results are also consistent with a theory according to which people have less difficulty processing embedded clauses whose word order matches the word order in main clauses. Some corpus analyses of Chinese texts provide results that constrain the classes of possible frequency-based theories. Critically, these results demonstrate that there is nothing intrinsically easy about extracting from subject position: depending on the word order in the main clause and in a relative clause, extraction from object position can be easier to process in some circumstances.},

  Abstract                 = {In 2 experiments, participants completed both an attentional control battery (OSPAN, antisaccade, and Stroop tasks) and a modified semantic priming task. The priming task measured relatedness proportion (RP) effects within subjects, with the color of the prime indicating the probability that the to-be-named target would be related. In Experiment 2, participants were cued before each trial with the probability of a related target. Stimulus onset asynchronies traditionally thought to tap automatic processing (267 ms) versus controlled processing (1,240 ms) were used. Across experiments, principal component analysis on the battery revealed a general attentional control component. Moreover, the RP effect increased linearly with attentional control in both experiments. It is concluded that RP effects produced in this paradigm depend purely upon the effortful process of expectancy generation, which renders them sensitive to individual differences in attentional control.},

  Abstract                 = {The N-back task is used extensively in literature as a working memory (WM) paradigm and it is increasingly used as a measure of individual differences. However, not much is known about the psychometric properties of this task and the current study aims to shed more light on this issue. We first review the current literature on the psychometric properties of the N-back task. With three experiments using task variants with different stimuli and load levels, we then investigate the nature of the N-back task by investigating its relationship to WM, and its role as an inter-individual difference measure. Consistent with previous literature, our data suggest that the N-back task is not a useful measure of individual differences in WM, partly because of its insufficient reliability. Nevertheless, the task seems to be useful for experimental research in WM and also well predicts inter-individual differences in other higher cognitive functions, such as fluid intelligence, especially when used at higher levels of load.},

  Abstract                 = {We use our sense of time to identify temporal relationships between events and to anticipate actions. The degree to which we can exploit temporal contingencies depends on the variability of our measurements of time. We asked humans to reproduce time intervals drawn from different underlying distributions. As expected, production times were more variable for longer intervals. However, production times exhibited a systematic regression toward the mean. Consequently, estimates for a sample interval differed depending on the distribution from which it was drawn. A performance-optimizing Bayesian model that takes the underlying distribution of samples into account provided an accurate description of subjects' performance, variability and bias. This finding suggests that the CNS incorporates knowledge about temporal uncertainty to adapt internal timing mechanisms to the temporal statistics of the environment.},

  Abstract                 = {The past 10 years have brought near-revolutionary changes in psychological theories about short-term memory, with similarly great advances in the neurosciences. Here, we critically examine the major psychological theories (the "mind") of short-term memory and how they relate to evidence about underlying brain mechanisms. We focus on three features that must be addressed by any satisfactory theory of short-term memory. First, we examine the evidence for the architecture of short-term memory, with special attention to questions of capacity and how--or whether--short-term memory can be separated from long-term memory. Second, we ask how the components of that architecture enact processes of encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Third, we describe the debate over the reason about forgetting from short-term memory, whether interference or decay is the cause. We close with a conceptual model tracing the representation of a single item through a short-term memory task, describing the biological mechanisms that might support psychological processes on a moment-by-moment basis as an item is encoded, maintained over a delay with some forgetting, and ultimately retrieved.},

As uncertainty increases the system should increasingly rely on prior knowledge. To use bayesian strategy, the brain would need to represent the prior distribution and the level of uncertainty in the sensory feedback. The central nervous system therefore employs probabilistic models during sensorimotor learning. It's been proposed that the architecture of the nervous system is well suited for bayesian inference (9-13)},

In Experiment 1, no differences between individuals with a low, medium, and high span were observed in how they distributed processing time between task elements. In all three groups, fixation times on words up to the to-be-remembered (TBR) word became shorter and the time spent on the TBR longer as memory load in the task increased. The results of Experiment 2, however, show that span groups differ in the use of memory encoding strategies: individuals with a low span use mainly rehearsal, whereas individuals with a high span use almost exclusively semantic elaboration. The results indicate that the use of elaborative strategies may enhance span performance but that not all individuals are necessarily able to use such strategies efficiently.},

  Abstract                 = {What do perceptually bistable figures, sentences vulnerable to misinterpretation and the Stroop task have in common? Although seemingly disparate, they all contain elements of conflict or ambiguity. Consequently, in order to monitor a fluctuating percept, reinterpret sentence meaning, or say "blue" when the word RED is printed in blue ink, individuals must regulate attention and engage cognitive control. According to the Conflict Monitoring Theory (Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, \& Cohen, 2001), the detection of conflict automatically triggers cognitive control mechanisms, which can enhance resolution of subsequent conflict, namely, "conflict adaptation." If adaptation reflects the recruitment of domain-general processes, then conflict detection in one domain should facilitate conflict resolution in an entirely different domain. We report two novel findings: (i) significant conflict adaptation from a syntactic to a non-syntactic domain and (ii) from a perceptual to a verbal domain, providing strong evidence that adaptation is mediated by domain-general cognitive control.},

Confirmatory' factor analyses and structural equation models indicated that the WM tasks largely reflected a domain-general factor, whereas STM tasks, based on the same stimuli as the WM tasks, were much more domain specific. The WM construct was a strong predictor of Gf and a weaker predictor of domain-specific reasoning, and the reverse was true for the STM construct.

  Abstract                 = {Older adults often have more difficulty listening in challenging environments than their younger adult counterparts. On the one hand, auditory aging can exacerbate and/or masquerade as cognitive difficulties when auditory processing is stressed in challenging listening situations. On the other hand, an older listener can overcome some auditory processing difficulties by deploying compensatory cognitive processing, especially when there is supportive context. Supportive context may be provided by redundant cues in the external signal(s) and/or by internally stored knowledge about structures that are functionally significant in communication. It seems that listeners may achieve correct word identification in various ways depending on the challenges and supports available in complex auditory scenes. We will review evidence suggesting that older adults benefit as much or more than younger adults from supportive context at multiple levels where expectations or constraints may be related to redundancies in semantic, syntactic, lexical, phonological, or other sub-phonemic cues in the signal, and/or to expert knowledge of structures at these levels.},

  Abstract                 = {When stimuli compete for sensory processing and response selection, coherent goal-guided behavior requires cognitive control so that task-relevant "targets" rather than irrelevant distractors are selected. It has been shown that reduced cognitive control under high working memory load increases distractor competition for selection. It remains unknown, though, whether cognitive control by working memory has an effect on the earliest levels of sensory processing in primary visual cortex. The present study addressed this question by having subjects perform a selective attention task involving classification of meaningful target objects while also ignoring congruent and incongruent distractor images. The level of cognitive control over distractor competition was varied through a concurrent working memory task of either low (1 digit) or high (6 digits) load. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed greater distractor competition effects not only on behavior but also on the sensory correlates in primary visual cortex (areas V1-V2) in conditions of high (vs. low) working memory load. In addition, high working memory load resulted in increased congruency-related functional connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex and V1. These results are the first to establish the neural correlates of distractor competition effects in primary visual cortex and the critical role of working memory in their cognitive control.},

Three experiments are described wherein participants completed an explicitly cued task-switching procedure. Experiment 1 established that task switches requiring a reconfiguration of both stimulus- and response-set incurred larger residual switch costs than task switches requiring the reconfiguration of stimulus-set alone. Between-task interference was also drastically reduced for response-set conflict compared with stimulus-set conflict. A second experiment replicated these findings and demonstrated that stimulus- and response-conflict have dissociable effects on the "decision time" and "motor time" components of total response time. Finally, a third experiment replicated Experiment 2 and demonstrated that the stimulus- and response- components of task switching and conflict processing elicit dissociable neural activity as evidence by event-related brain potentials.},

Reading the verbs of an object relative sentence, such as The reporter that the senator attacked admitted the error, takes more time for readers with less working memory capacity for language, and their resulting comprehension is less accurate. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of a concurrent working memory load and found that with no load or a small memory load many Low Span readers comprehended object relative sentences very poorly although their reading times in the critical area of these sentences were greater than those of High Span subjects. Experiment 2 replicated the reading time effects of Experiment 1 for object relative sentences and showed that pragmatic information improved the comprehension of the lower capacity readers, although their use of this information was limited to the clause in which it was presented.},

Seventy-one non-college-bound 16-24 year-old speakers of English completed a battery of 18 verbal and cognitive skill assessments, and read a series of sentences as their eye-movements were monitored. Statistical analyses were performed to establish what tests of reading abilities were predictive of eye-movement patterns across this population and how strong the effects were. We found that individual scores in rapid automatized naming and word identification tests (i) were the only participant variables with reliable predictivity throughout the time-course of reading; (ii) elicited effects that superceded in magnitude the effects of established predictors like word length or frequency; and (iii) strongly modulated the influence of word length and frequency on fixation times. We discuss implications of our findings for testing reading ability, as well as for research of eye-movements in reading.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of recent electrophysiological studies of sentence processing have shown that a subclass of syntactic violations elicits very rapid ERP responses, occurring within around 200 ms of the onset of the violation. Such findings raise the question of how it is possible to diagnose violations so quickly. This paper suggests that very rapid diagnosis of errors is possible specifically in situations where the diagnosis problem is tightly constrained by specific expectations generated before the critical word is presented. In an event-related potentials (ERP) study of visual sentence reading participants encountered violations of a word order constraint (...Max's of...) that has elicited early ERP responses in previous studies. Across conditions the illicit sequence was held constant, while sentence context was used to manipulate the expectation for a noun following the possessor Max's, by manipulating the possibility of ellipsis of the head noun. Results showed that the anterior negativity elicited by the word category violation was attenuated when the availability of ellipsis reduced the expectation for a noun in the position of the offending preposition of, with divergence between conditions starting around 200 ms after the onset of the violation. This suggests a role for structural expectations in accounting for very fast syntactic diagnosis processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Much previous research has demonstrated that visual search is typically disrupted by the presence of a unique "singleton" distractor in the search display. Here we show that attentional capture by an irrelevant color singleton during shape search critically depends on availability of working memory to the search task: When working memory is loaded in a concurrent yet unrelated verbal short-term memory task, capture increases. These findings converge with previous demonstrations that increasing working memory load results in greater distractor interference in Stroop-like tasks (de Fockert, Rees, Frith, \& Lavie, 2001; Lavie, Hirst, de Fockert, \& Viding, 2004), which support the hypothesis that working memory provides goal-directed control of visual selective attention allowing to minimize interference by goal-irrelevant distractors.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates the role of resource allocation as a source of processing difficulty in human sentence comprehension. The paper proposes a simple information-theoretic characterization of processing difficulty as the work incurred by resource reallocation during parallel, incremental, probabilistic disambiguation in sentence comprehension, and demonstrates its equivalence to the theory of Hale [Hale, J. (2001). A probabilistic Earley parser as a psycholinguistic model. In Proceedings of NAACL (Vol. 2, pp. 159-166)], in which the difficulty of a word is proportional to its surprisal (its negative log-probability) in the context within which it appears. This proposal subsumes and clarifies findings that high-constraint contexts can facilitate lexical processing, and connects these findings to well-known models of parallel constraint-based comprehension. In addition, the theory leads to a number of specific predictions about the role of expectation in syntactic comprehension, including the reversal of locality-based difficulty patterns in syntactically constrained contexts, and conditions under which increased ambiguity facilitates processing. The paper examines a range of established results bearing on these predictions, and shows that they are largely consistent with the surprisal theory.},
  Annote                   = {predictability is generally considered a primarily se- mantic phenomenon; but surprisal differences can derive from any source, including syntax, morphology and phonology as well as semantics. under surprisal, difficulty occurs when resources are distributed in a way that is not highly compatible with the continuation of the sentence. In another manner of speaking, the comprehender’s expectation as to the location of the final verb sharpens as the clause lengthens.},

  Abstract                 = {Many models of short-term memory (STM) ascribe an important role to temporal decay and forgetting because of the passage of time alone. We argue against decay as the primary form of forgetting from STM, and suggest that new experimental methodologies and recent models provide new perspectives on the old issue of the causes of forgetting. We show that several classic sources of evidence for time-based forgetting can be re-interpreted in terms of an interference-based view, and that new experiments provide compelling evidence against decay. We conclude that progress requires moving beyond demonstrations of qualitative effects and focusing instead on testing quantitative predictions of models.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a detailed process theory of the moment-by-moment working-memory retrievals and associated control structure that subserve sentence comprehension. The theory is derived from the application of independently motivated principles of memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of sentence parsing. The resulting theory construes sentence processing as a series of skilled associative memory retrievals modulated by similarity-based interference and fluctuating activation. The cognitive principles are formalized in computational form in the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) architecture, and our process model is realized in ACT-R. We present the results of 6 sets of simulations: 5 simulation sets provide quantitative accounts of the effects of length and structural interference on both unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of double center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to extremely difficult. The explanation of center-embedding difficulty is a novel one that derives from the model' complete reliance on discriminating retrieval cues in the absence of an explicit representation of serial order information. All fits were obtained with only 1 free scaling parameter fixed across the simulations; all other parameters were ACT-R defaults. The modeling results support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference are the key factors shaping working memory in sentence processing. We contrast the theory and empirical predictions with several related accounts of sentence-processing complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding a sentence requires a working memory of the partial products of comprehension, so that linguistic relations between temporally distal parts of the sentence can be rapidly computed. We describe an emerging theoretical framework for this working memory system that incorporates several independently motivated principles of memory: a sharply limited attentional focus, rapid retrieval of item (but not order) information subject to interference from similar items, and activation decay (forgetting over time). A computational model embodying these principles provides an explanation of the functional capacities and severe limitations of human processing, as well as accounts of reading times. The broad implication is that the detailed nature of cross-linguistic sentence processing emerges from the interaction of general principles of human memory with the specialized task of language comprehension.},
  Annote                   = {From Duplicate 1 ( Computational principles of working memory in sentence comprehension. - Lewis, Richard L; Vasishth, Shravan; Van Dyke, Julie A ) From Duplicate 1 ( Computational principles of working memory in sentence comprehension. - Lewis, Richard L; Vasishth, Shravan; Van Dyke, Julie a ) The language-processing system must therefore maintain, at least momentarily, some memory of linguistic material. For example, in sentences with long-distance dependencies such as (1), the noun phrase (NP) ‘a toy’ must be maintained in memory until it is interpreted as the object of ‘like’:(1) This weekend we bought a toy that Amparo really hoped Melissa would like. In general, establishing any kind of linguistic relationship requires some memory of the immediate past. This functional requirement gives rise to the following theore- tical question:what are the working memory processes that bring prior linguistic material into contact with present material, and what are the constraints on those processes? nature of retrieval from verbal working memory: *Limited focus of attention (McElree, B. (2006) Accessing recent events. In) *Fast, parallel associative retrieval of item information: fast retrieval that involves a parallel match of cues against all items in memory. McElree, B. (2006) *Slow, serial access to serial order information SAT paradigms also provide compelling evidence against fast parallel access of serial order information. McElree, B. (2006) The basic idea is that each incoming word triggers retrievals to integrate that word with the preceding structure. Retrieval is accom- plished by a simple type of associative access: content- based retrieval, where the retrieval cues are a subset of the features of the item to be retrieved So what are the retrieval cues? However, the model does not claim that words trigger the retrievals of other words via lexical associa- tions. What is being retrieved are partial representations of linguistic constituents, not words (represented as fea- ture bundles, or ‘chunks’ [16,28]), and the cues that drive the retrieval are not simply features of the lexical item but are grammatically derived from the current word and context. And what's retrieved exactly? Dependency Locality Theory [2], distance is quantified by the number of new discourse referents that intervene between a head (e.g. a verb) and its dependents (its arguments); this calculation includes verbal elements and the dependent itself. The bottom line is that expected locality effects do not always arise: a comprehensive theory must account for the highly circumscribed contexts in which they do arise and also their complete reversal in some cases. The broader implication is that it might not be necessary to make assumptions about the appropriate linguistic metric of distance – the fundamental metric instead might be time.},

  Annote                   = {Waters and colleagues (1987) found a larger effect of the concurrent articulation of a random six-digit load versus that of a familiar six- digit load (i.e., the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) on semantic acceptability judgments to sentences. Moreover, the maintenance of the random digit load was more detrimental for judgments about difficult, object-relativized sentences than for those about the easier, subject-relativized sentences. This interaction suggests that the processing of syntactic difficulty and the maintenance of a random digit sequence compete for executive control. On the other hand, in a sentence-picture matching task, Waters, Caplan and Rochon (1995) found that patients with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type as well as their controls recalled a random sequence of digits equally well after processing a difficult sentence (in terms of syntactic complexity) than after processing a simple sentence, suggesting that the tasks do not share executive control. Digit-recall performance was calculated using a transformation of Kendall’srank correlation coefficient tau ($\tau$’), which reflects the proportion of digits recalled in correct relative order. Values range between 0 and 1. Higher values reflect many recalled items in correct order, whereas low values reflect strongly violated order or few recalled items (for details see Szmalec \& Vandierendonck, 2007).

Carpenter's (1992) capacity theory of comprehension posits a linguistic workingmemory functionally separated from the representation of linguistic knowledge. G. S. Waters and D.Caplan's (1996) critique of this approach retained the notion of a separate working memory. In thisarticle, the authors present an alternative account motivated by a connectionist approach to languagecomprehension. In their view, processing capacity emerges from network architecture and experienceand is not a primitive that can vary independently. Individual differences in comprehension do not stemfrom variations in a separate working memory capacity; instead they emerge from an interaction ofbiological factors and language experience. This alternative is argued to provide a superior account ofcomprehension results previously attributed to a separate working memory capacity.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a model that explains how the working-memory capacity of a comprehender can constrain syntactic parsing and thereby affect the processing of syntactic ambiguities. The model's predictions are examined in four experiments that measure the reading times for two constructions that contain a temporary syntactic ambiguity. An example of the syntactic ambiguity is The soldiers warned about the dangers . . . ; the verb warned may either be the main verb, in which case soldiers is the agent; or the verb warned may introduce a relative clause, in which case soldiers is the patient of warned rather than the agent, as in The soldiers warned about the dangers conducted the midnight raid. The model proposes that both alternative interpretations of warned are initially activated. However, the duration for which both interpretations are maintained depends, in part, on the reader's working-memory capacity, which can be assessed by the Reading Span task (Daneman \& Carpenter, 1980). The word-by-word reading times indicate that all subjects do additional processing after encountering an ambiguity, suggesting that they generate both representations. Furthermore, readers with larger working-memory capacities maintain both representations for some period of time (several words), whereas readers with smaller working-memory capacities revert to maintaining only the more likely representation.},

  Abstract                 = {Various noncanonical sentence constructions are derived from basic sentence structures by a phrase displacement called Movement. The moved phrase (filler) leaves a silent copy at the extracted position (gap) and is reactivated when the hearer/reader passes over the gap. Consequently, memory operations are assumed to occur to establish the filler-gap link. For languages that have a relatively free word order like German, a distinct linguistic operation called Scrambling is proposed. Although Movement and Scrambling are assumed to be different linguistic operations, they both involve memory prone filler-gap processes. To clarify whether filler-gap memory processes in Scrambling and Movement differ neuroanatomically, we designed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study and compared the effect of memory load parameterized by filler-gap distance in the 2 sentence types. Here, we show that processing of the 2 sentence types commonly relies on a left hemispheric network consisting of the inferior frontal gyrus, middle part of the middle temporal gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus. However, we found differences for the 2 sentence types in the linearity of filler-gap distance effect. Thus, the present results suggest that the same neural substrate supports the memory processes of sentences constructed by Movement and Scrambling, although differentially modulated by memory load.},

  Annote                   = {McElree results conection with locality? maybe in this kind of sentences, the parser fails to access to the filler and tries again, by re-reading or bu spending longer time. And this would explain locality effects. BUT why didn't the subject continue trying to retrieve the filler? This will raise the accuracy for a later time. Maybe their subjects misanalyzed the sentences every time they were wrong? If this is true anti-locality effects show the opposite effect. Experiment 2 showed that adjacent arguments were processed faster than arguments separated by one or more constituents, and that very complex syntactic structures were pro- cessed slower than simpler structures, Experiment 3 demonstrated that processingwas slower when the sen- tence required resolvingtwo nonadjacent dependencies rather than one. -- Basic research investigating retrieval processes inWM indicates that memory representations can be accessed in one of two ways (McElree, 1996, 1998, 2001; McElree \& Dosher, 1989, 1993). Some types of memory structures can be directly accessed with a content-addressable retrieval operation, while other structures require a slower search process. Recoveringan item from memory appears to be mediated by a content-addressable mech- anism. In contrast, recoveringorder or relational infor- mation from memory appears to require a relatively slow search process. The timecourse measures reported here suggest that basic binding operations that enable pro- cessingof long-distance dependencies like (1) or nonad- jacent dependencies like (2) are mediated by memory representations that are directly accessible. we argue that sentence processing is subserved by content-addressable memory structures in which syntactic and semantic constraints provide the retrieval cues that enable direct access to needed repre- sentations. The defining property of a content-addressable re-trieval process is that information (cues) in the retrieval context enables direct access to relevant memory repre- sentations, without the need to search through extra- neous memory representations. search process, in which memory representations are searched by location or some other organizing principle (Gillund \& Shiffrin, 1984). Efficiency arguments carry less weight for the retrieval of recent events, however, if those events are represented in a more limited-capacity WM system. Indeed, traditional models of the retrieval of short-term representations have argued that the pri- mary means of gaining access to an item in WM is through a search process with either a serial architecture (e.g., Sternberg, 1966, 1975; Theios, 1973; Treisman \& Doctor, 1987) or a parallel architecture (e.g., Murdock, 1971; Townsend \& Ashby, 1983). With a search mechanism, retrieval speed will slow as potentially interferingmaterial is added to the memory system. In contrast, additional material need not affect retrieval speed in a memory system with a direct access mechanism. Interpolated material may decrease the quality of a memory representation (through makingthe representation less likely to be recovered in any particular context, but a direct-access mechanism nonetheless enables representations of differingquality or strength to be retrieved in equal time (e.g., McElree \& Dosher, 1989; Ratcliff, 1978). [arguable] McElree and Dosher found that the number of items in memory (set size) and the number of items interpolated between study and test (recency of the test probe) ad- versely affected the probability of retrievingan item. neither set size nor recency affected the speed of retrieval. Search models, whether serial or parallel in form, are incompatible with findings that representations of differing availability are nevertheless equally accessible These data indicate that access to an items representation in memory is direct, and suggest that retrieval from WM is mediated by a content-addressable mechanism McElree (2000) found that overall response accuracywas adversely affected by the amount of interpolated material. Consistent with standard findings in memory research and particular models of memory for sentence processing(Lewis, 1996), the probability of accessinga representation of the filler item may decrease as the amount of interpolated material increases. However, processingspeed did not vary across (3)–(5), indicatingthat readers could access the filler item equally quickly when zero, one, or two embedded clauses separated the filler and gap. This pattern suggests, perhaps surprisingly, that a search mechanism was not used to access a representation of the filler item. The timecourse profiles are analogous to what is observed in simple item recognition, and mark- edly distinct from the patterns observed in the recovery of order information (McElree, 1996, 1998, 2001; McElree \& Dosher, 1989, 1993). The data suggest that the memory representation of the filler item is directly accessible when the matrix verb is encountered. SAT interpretation If additional material decreases only the overall accuracy of re- sponding, the corresponding functions will differ in as- ymptotic level alone. The pre-asymptotic portion of the SAT functionmeasures processingspeed or dynamics, jointly specified by the intercept of the function (when accuracy departs from chance, d0 ¼ 0) and the rate at which accuracy grows from intercept to asymptote. The intercept mea- sures the minimum time needed to form an interpreta- tion that would serve to discriminate acceptable from unacceptable forms. The rate of the SAT function re- flects either the rate of continuous information accrual if processingis continuous or the distribution of finishing times if processingis discrete or quantal (Dosher, 1976, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1984; Meyer, Irwin, Osman, \& Kou- nois, 1988). In either case, differences in intercept or rate implicate underlyingdifferences in the speed of pro- cessing. --- Readers are thought to actively postulate a gap for a marked filler item—in this case the clefted NP—in every legal syntactic position. Readers may actively maintain a representation of the dislocated constituent in focal attention until a syntactic-semantic role has been found, thereby cir- cumventingthe retrieval processes that would otherwise be needed to restore the constituent to active processing were it not held in focal attention. the quality of the retrieval cues can affect the probability of retrievinga memory representation but need not affect th9 e speed at which the representation can be retrieved (Ratcliff, Van Zandt, \& McKoon, 1999; for appli- cations to WM, see McElree \& Dosher, 1989) ---- For the double-gap conditions, there is a trend for slower processingin the long as compared to the short conditions, but this trend is only evident in four out of the eight participants.

  Abstract                 = {Some people are better readers than others, and this variation in comprehension ability is predicted by measures of working memory capacity (WMC). The primary goal of this study was to investigate the mediating role of mind-wandering experiences in the association between WMC and normal individual differences in reading comprehension, as predicted by the executive-attention theory of WMC (e.g., Engle \& Kane, 2004). We used a latent-variable, structural-equation-model approach, testing skilled adult readers on 3 WMC span tasks, 7 varied reading-comprehension tasks, and 3 attention-control tasks. Mind wandering was assessed using experimenter-scheduled thought probes during 4 different tasks (2 reading, 2 attention-control). The results support the executive-attention theory of WMC. Mind wandering across the 4 tasks loaded onto a single latent factor, reflecting a stable individual difference. Most important, mind wandering was a significant mediator in the relationship between WMC and reading comprehension, suggesting that the WMC–comprehension correlation is driven, in part, by attention control over intruding thoughts. We discuss implications for theories of WMC, attention control, and reading comprehension.},
  Annote                   = {From Duplicate 2 ( Why does working memory capacity predict variation in reading comprehension? On the influence of mind wandering and executive attention. - McVay, Jennifer C; Kane, Michael J ) That is, individuals with lower WMC should have greater comprehension deficits, in part because they are less able to maintain on-task thought. TUTs should displace the task goal of comprehending the reading material and thus disrupt a person’s ability to process relevant details and build a mental model of the text for comprehension (see Smallwood, McSpadden, \& Schooler, 2008). Reading-comprehension variation occurs at both a micro level, in processing syntax of textual elements, and a macro level, such as apprehending the text’s meaning as a whole (Kintsch \& van Dijk, 1978). In other words, readers must first parse the individual words and sentences in the text before they can holistically generate an accurate situa- tion model and appropriate inferences. The variation in compre- hension among skilled readers’ does not tend to depend as greatly on variation in microlevel functions as it does among unskilled, or novice, readers (Palmer, MacLeod, Hunt, \& Davidson, 1985). Novice readers, in contrast, seem to engage more resources on microlevel functions (e.g., identifying words) and are therefore less able to create coherence from the material. WMC correlated strongly with three different measures of reading comprehension, including scores on the verbal SAT, and they did so much more strongly than did a simple word span task.Danman and Carpenter’s (1980) Daneman and Merikle’s(1996) meta-analysis concluded that individual differences in WMC significantly predict reading comprehension, with correla- tions in the moderate to strong range (rs = .30–.52). Daneman and colleagues suggested that readers with lowerWMChave less capacity to integrate information from the text and from background knowledge into a working mental model (e.g., Daneman \& Carpenter, 1980; Daneman \& Merikle, 1996; Hannon \& Daneman, 2001) WMC/executive-attention and reading comprehension was only partially mediated by TUT rate suggests that some executive-related processes that are indepen- dent of thought control are important to reading},

  Abstract                 = {The proposal of a general conflict resolution mechanism in lIFG was investigated further in relation to language errors. In an fMRI study participants read sentences containing syntactic and plausibility violations. Furthermore, they were presented with sentences that were difficult to comprehend, due to degradation of the bottom-up signal (i.e., the visual form) of the language. We were interested whether comprehension difficulties caused by degradation would activate cognitive control mechanisms in the same manner as other language violations. To localize cognitive control processes participants performed a Stroop task. Both the violations and the visual degradation condition elicited co-localized lIFG activation with the Stroop conflict. These results indicate that lIFG implements control adjustments to resolve situations in which extra attention is needed more generally. Next to biasing attention to resolve representational conflicts arising from different types of errors, lIFG may also adjust control to compensate for a temporary lack of bottom-up information.},

  Abstract                 = {While numerous studies have implicated both anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex in attentional control, the nature of their involvement remains a source of debate. Here we determine the extent to which their relative involvement in attentional control depends upon the levels of processing at which the conflict occurs (e.g., response, non-response). Using a combination of blocked and rapid presentation event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques, we compared neural activity during incongruent Stroop trial types that produce conflict at different levels of processing. Our data suggest that the involvement of anterior cingulate and right prefrontal cortex in attentional control is primarily limited to situations of response conflict, while the involvement of left prefrontal cortex extends to the occurrence of conflict at non-response levels.},

  Abstract                 = {When people read temporarily ambiguous sentences, there is often an increased prevalence of regressive eye-movements launched from the word that resolves the ambiguity. Traditionally, such regressions have been interpreted at least in part as reflecting readers’ efforts to re-read and reconfigure earlier material, as exemplified by the Selective Reanalysis hypothesis [Frazier, L., \& Rayner, K. (1982). Making and correcting errors during sentence comprehension: Eye movements in the analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences. Cognitive Psychology, 14, 178–210]. Within such frameworks it is assumed that the selection of saccadic landing-sites is linguistically supervised. As an alternative to this proposal, we consider the possibility (dubbed the Time Out hypothesis) that regression control is partly decoupled from linguistic operations and that landing-sites are instead selected on the basis of low-level spatial properties such as their proximity to the point from which the regressive saccade was launched. Two eye-tracking experiments were conducted to compare the explanatory potential of these two accounts. Experiment 1 manipulated the formatting of linguistically identical sentences and showed, contrary to purely linguistic supervision, that the landing site of the first regression from a critical word was reliably influenced by the physical layout of the text. Experiment 2 used a fixed physical format but manipulated the position in the display at which reanalysis-relevant material was located. Here the results showed a highly reliable linguistic influence on the overall distribution of regression landing sites (though with few effects being apparent on the very first regression). These results are interpreted as reflecting mutually exclusive forms of regression control with fixation sequences being influenced both by spatially constrained, partially decoupled supervision systems as well as by some kind of linguistic guidance. The findings are discussed in relation to existing computational models of eye-movements in reading.},

Rapid automatized naming (RAN) tasks provide insight into this system, acting as a microcosm of the processes involved in reading. In this review, we examine both RAN and reading fluency and how each has shaped our understanding of reading disabilities. We explore the research that led to our current understanding of the relationships between RAN and reading and what makes RAN unique as a cognitive measure. We explore how the automaticity that supports RAN affects reading across development, reading abilities, and languages, and the biological bases of these processes. Finally, we bring these converging areas of knowledge together by examining what the collective studies of RAN and reading fluency contribute to our goals of creating optimal assessments and interventions that help every child become a fluent, comprehending reader.},

The need for cognitive control in these tasks depends on the presence of ‘conflict’ in the designs. The term ‘conflict’ denotes instances in which cur- rent situation-specific demands give rise to an incongruity between how a stimulus should be represented or responded to, in view of how the stimulus is ordinarily characterized (think of Stroop). * ‘prepotent response conflict’, because individuals must override their dominant (prepotent) biases in favor of disfavored alternatives (see Botvinick et al. 2001). * conflict can arise in the form of ‘under- determined response conflict’, in which multiple response candidates are equally plausible and therefore compete for selection (Botvinick et al. 2001). we rely on the build-up of syntactic and semantic evidence to guide us toward an interpretation, and, along the way, we make our ‘best-guess’ estimate about what is likely to come next (see Pickering and Van Gompel 2006; Tanenhaus 2007; Trueswell and Gleitman 2007) this is for garden path but I may be able to use it for expectations Ye and Zhou (2008) also reported findings from an eventrelated potential (ERP) study in which participants were first divided into high- versus low-cognitive control ability as indexed by their Stroop performance. This grouping factor predicted variations in both ERP patterns for the plausibility contrast, and the degree of processing difficulty readers experienced. Further, patterns of ERP activity reli- ably predicted the size of individuals’ Stroop-incongruence effects. These correspondences suggest that cognitive control mechanisms are involved in recovering from misinterpreta- tion when readers must resolve conflict between incompatible representations of sentence meaning. Additional analyses revealed that general processing speed and working memory capacity could not account for these effects. Overall, the results strongly imply that indi- vidual differences in parsing abilities—especially concerning reanalysis—can be captured by normal variation in cognitive control function.},

Unambiguous descriptions were compatible with a single spatial arrangement, whereas ambiguous descriptions permitted two arrangements; a subset of the ambiguous descriptions still determined the relation asserted in the conclusion, whereas another subset did not. Two groups of participants received different instructions: The deduction group should accept conclusions only if they followed with logical necessity from the description, whereas the comprehension group should accept a conclusion if it agreed with their representation of the arrangement. Self-paced reading times increased on sentences that introduced an ambiguity, replicating previous findings in deductive reasoning experiments. This effect was also found in the comprehension group, casting doubt on the interpretation that people consider multiple possible arrangements online. Responses to conclusions could be modelled by a multinomial processing model with four parameters: the probability of constructing a correct mental model, the probability of detecting an ambiguity, and two guessing parameters. Participants with high and with low WMC differed mainly in the probability of successfully constructing a mental model.},

  Abstract                 = {Prior research has indicated that readers and listeners can use information in the prior discourse to rapidly predict specific upcoming words, as the text is unfolding. Here we used event-related potentials to explore whether the ability to make rapid online predictions depends on a reader's working memory capacity (WMC). Readers with low WMC were hypothesized to differ from high WMC readers either in their overall capability to make predictions (because of their lack of cognitive resources). High and low WMC participants read highly constraining stories that supported the prediction of a specific noun, mixed with coherent but essentially unpredictive 'prime control' control stories that contained the same content words as the predictive stories. To test whether readers were anticipating upcoming words, critical nouns were preceded by a determiner whose gender agreed or disagreed with the gender of the expected noun. In predictive stories, both high and low WMC readers displayed an early negative deflection (300-600 ms) to unexpected determiners, which was not present in prime control stories. Only the low WMC participants displayed an additional later negativity (900-1500 ms) to unexpected determiners. This pattern of results suggests that WMC does not influence the ability to anticipate upcoming words per se, but does change the way in which readers deal with information that disconfirms the generated prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most widely used tasks for measuring working memory capacity is the operation span task (OSPAN; Turner \& Engle, 1989). This task has almost always been applied individually, and stimuli presentation is controlled by the experimenter. Recently, De Neys, d'Ydewalle, Schaeken, and Vos (2002) improved the administration procedure by designing an automated, group-administrable version of the task (GOSPAN). They found GOSPAN to be reliable, and they also provided evidence on its validity (a significant positive correlation between GOSPAN and OSPAN scores). However, an external test of GOSPAN validity is still lacking. In this work, we present such a validation for the automated version, when the task is administered both individually (Experiment 1) and to groups (Experiment 2). There are abundant previous data on the relation between working memory capacity and reading comprehension. In this work, this relation is studied using an automated OSPAN version to measure working memory capacity. Given that our results are similar to those found using the original OSPAN, our data support the external validity of the automated version of the task. We also tested the reliability of the task and found high internal consistency in both experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {We report an investigation of aging and individual differences in binding information during sentence understanding. An age-continuous sample of adults (N=91), ranging from 18 to 81years of age, read sentences in which a relative clause could be attached high to a head noun NP1, attached low to its modifying prepositional phrase NP2 (e.g., The son of the princess who scratched himself/herself in public was humiliated), or in which the attachment site of the relative clause was ultimately indeterminate (e.g., The maid of the princess who scratched herself in public was humiliated). Word-by-word reading times and comprehension (e.g., who scratched?) were measured. A series of mixed-effects models were fit to the data, revealing: (1) that, on average, NP1-attached sentences were harder to process and comprehend than NP2-attached sentences; (2) that these average effects were independently moderated by verbal working memory capacity and reading experience, with effects that were most pronounced in the oldest participants and; (3) that readers on average did not allocate extra time to resolve global ambiguities, though older adults with higher working memory span did. Findings are discussed in relation to current models of lifespan cognitive development, working memory, language experience, and the role of prosodic segmentation strategies in reading. Collectively, these data suggest that aging brings differences in sentence understanding, and these differences may depend on independent influences of verbal working memory capacity and reading experience.},

  abstract = {Expectation-driven facilitation (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and locality-driven retrieval difficulty (Gibson, 1998, 2000; Lewis &
Vasishth, 2005) are widely recognized to be two critical factors in incremental sentence processing; there is accumulating
evidence that both can influence processing difficulty. However, it is unclear whether and how expectations and memory
interact. We first confirm a key prediction of the expectation account: a Hindi self-paced reading study shows that when an
expectation for an upcoming part of speech is dashed, building a rarer structure consumes more processing time than
building a less rare structure. This is a strong validation of the expectation-based account. In a second study, we show that
when expectation is strong, i.e., when a particular verb is predicted, strong facilitation effects are seen when the appearance
of the verb is delayed; however, when expectation is weak, i.e., when only the part of speech ``verb'' is predicted but a
particular verb is not predicted, the facilitation disappears and a tendency towards a locality effect is seen. The interaction
seen between expectation strength and distance shows that strong expectations cancel locality effects, and that weak
expectations allow locality effects to emerge.},

  abstract = {An English double-embedded relative clause from which the middle verb is omitted can often be processed more easily than its grammatical counterpart, a phenomenon known as the grammaticality illusion. This effect has been found to be reversed in German, suggesting that the illusion is language specific rather than a consequence of universal working memory constraints. We present results from three self-paced reading experiments which show that Dutch native speakers also do not show the grammaticality illusion in Dutch, whereas both German and Dutch native speakers do show the illusion when reading English sentences. These findings provide evidence against working memory constraints as an explanation for the observed effect in English. We propose an alternative account based on the statistical patterns of the languages involved. In support of this alternative, a single recurrent neural network model that is trained on both Dutch and English sentences indeed predicts the cross-linguistic difference in grammaticality effect.},

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive neuroscience research on working memory has been largely motivated by a standard model that arose from the melding of psychological theory with neuroscience data. Among the tenets of this standard model are that working memory functions arise from the operation of specialized systems that act as buffers for the storage and manipulation of information, and that frontal cortex (particularly prefrontal cortex) is a critical neural substrate for these specialized systems. However, the standard model has been a victim of its own success, and can no longer accommodate many of the empirical findings of studies that it has motivated. An alternative is proposed: Working memory functions arise through the coordinated recruitment, via attention, of brain systems that have evolved to accomplish sensory-, representation-, and action-related functions. Evidence from behavioral, neuropsychological, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies, from monkeys and humans, is considered, as is the question of how to interpret delay-period activity in the prefrontal cortex.},

(Similar ideas have also been proposed by Davis and Holmes (2005), and entertained by Magnussen et al. (1998) and by Vogel et al. (2001).)},

  Annote                   = {One of the best understood links between individual differences in brain function and cognitive abilities is that more-skilled individuals generally accomplish a task more effi- ciently, using fewer mental resources, than less skilled individuals (Haier et al. 1988; Max- well et al. 1974; Neubauer and Fink 2009; Prat and Just forthcoming; Prat et al. 2007, 2011; Reichle et al. 2000). Prat et al. (2010a) conducted a multiple regression analysis of 84 readers, using indices of vocabulary size, working-memory capacity, age, handedness, and sex to predict patterns of activation. They found that the best predictor of efficiency was vocabulary size, with high-vocabulary readers showing reliably less activation, primarily increased language comprehension ability is manifest in part by more effi-cient neural processing of linguistic tasks. The resulting efficiency leaves a skilled individ- ual with greater available resources for engaging in additional, non-essential, elaborative processes. Prat et al.’s (2007) investigation of individual differences in sentence comprehension extended these results in young adults, to show that higher-working-memory-capacity individuals had better network synchroni-zation than did lower-capacity individuals.They found that functional connectivity between the key regions in the LH language network (including between Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas) was higher in readers with better working-memory capacities than in readers with worse working-memory capacities during sentence comprehension. Reduced connectivity between components of the language comprehension network has also been implicated as a source of processing difficulty in individuals with develop- mental language impairments With respect to language comprehension processes, in two analyses where individual word knowledge (as indexed by vocabulary scores) and working memory capacities (as indexed by reading span scores) were allowed to compete for variance, word knowledge was a better predic- tor of neural efficiency than was working memory capacity (Prat and Just forthcoming; Prat et al. 2010a). The relation between print exposure and word knowledge has been well established (Cunningham and Stanovich 1997; Stanovich and Cunningham 1992). Thus, it is plausible that the observed reduction of activation in high comprehenders results from increased experience with or exposure to language comprehension tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {Two experiments were conducted to investigate discourse representation in the two cerebral hemispheres as a function of reading skill. We used a lateralized visual-field procedure to compare left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) sensitivity to different discourse relations in readers with varying skill levels. In Experiment 1, we investigated two levels of discourse representation in memory: (a) the propositional representation and (b) the discourse model. We found that all readers were sensitive to propositional relations in the LH. In contrast, sensitivity to propositional relations in the RH increased as a function of reading skill. In addition, reading skill was positively related to topic relations in the LH, whereas it was negatively in the RH. In Experiment 2, we investigated propositional relations of different distances and again found that all readers were sensitive to propositional relations in the LH, whereas sensitivity to propositional relations in the RH was negatively related to reading skill. In general, reading skill appears to be associated with left-lateralized discourse representations.},

  Abstract                 = {Working memory and attention interact in a way that enables us to focus on relevant items and maintain current goals. The influence of working memory on attention has been noted in several studies using dual task designs. Multitasking increases the demands on working memory and reduces the amount of resources available for cognitive control functions such as resolving stimulus conflict. However, few studies have investigated the temporal activation of the cortex while multitasking. The present study addresses the extent to which working memory load influences early (P1) and late (P300) attention-sensitive event-related potential components using a dual task paradigm. Participants performed an arrow flanker task alone (single task condition) or concurrently with a Sternberg memory task (dual task condition). In the flanker task, participants responded to the direction of a central arrow surrounded by congruent or incongruent arrows. In the dual task condition, participants were presented with a Sternberg task that consisted of either four or seven consonants to remember prior to a short block of flanker trials. Participants were slower and less accurate on incongruent versus congruent trials. Furthermore, accuracy on incongruent trials was reduced in both dual task conditions. Likewise, P300 amplitude to incongruent flanker stimuli decreased when working memory load increased. These findings suggest that interference from incongruent flankers was more difficult to suppress when working memory was taxed. In addition, P1 amplitude was diminished on all flanker trials in the dual task condition. This result indicates that top-down attentional control over early visual processing is diminished by increasing demands on working memory. Both the behavioral and electrophysiological results suggest that working memory is critical in maintaining attentional focus and resolving conflict.},
  Annote                   = {But what happens when working memory is filled with items that are irrelevant for the goals required by a secondary task? Lavie and colleagues (de Fockert and Lavie, 2001; Lavie et al., 2004; Lavie, 2005; Lavie and de Fockert, 2005) have demonstrated that increasing the demands on working memory reduces the ability to ignore irrelevant stimuli. T * memory set + faces (de Fockert et al., 2001) Similar to the studies reported by Lavie et al. (2004, 2005), we varied cognitive load by using a memory set containing either four or seven items. it was expected that incongru- ent flankers would increase RTs, specifically in the high working memory load condition (Lavie et al., 2004, 2005).},

In the response signal procedure, a stimulus is presented and then, at one of a number of experimenter-determined times, a signal to respond is presented. The models were fit to the data from the two procedures simultaneously under the assumption that responses in the response signal procedure were based on a mixture of decision processes that had already terminated at response boundaries before the signal and decision processes that had not yet terminated. In the latter case, decisions were based on partial information in one variant of each model or on guessing in a second variant. Both variants of the diffusion model fit the data well and both fit better than either variant of the LCA model, although the differences in numerical goodness-of-fit measures were not large enough to allow decisive selection between the models.},

  Abstract                 = {Two experiments are reported that examine the time course of retrieval in a sentence matching procedure. Subjects learned lists of active and passive sentences and were tested with sentences in active or passive, correct or incorrect versions; for example, if "John hit Bill" was a studied sentence, "Bill hit John" would be an incorrect active test sentence. A response signal procedure was used so that accuracy could be measured as a function of time. The data show that sentences containing words from studied sentences are discriminable early in processing from sentences containing all new words, but discrimination of correct from incorrect versions of studied sentences occurs only later in processing (after 600-700 ms). These results demonstrate that different kinds of information are available at different points during the time course of retrieval and so suggest that modifications are required of models that provide only a unitary value for the amount of match between a test probe and information in memory. Early in processing, the growth of accuracy can be explained by a simple model that assumes independent contributions to total amount of match for each of the content words of a sentence, but this independent processing model cannot account for discrimination later in processing. Several, more general, memory models are examined with respect to their abilities to produce independent item information early in processing and relational information later in processing.},

Basic topics discussed with respect to reading are (a) the characteristics of eye movements, (b) the perceptual span, (c) integration of information across saccades, (d) eye movement control, and (e) individual differences (including dyslexia). Similar topics are discussed with respect to the other tasks examined. The basic theme of the review is that eye movement data reflect moment-to-moment cognitive processes in the various tasks examined. Theoretical and practical considerations concerning the use of eye movement data are also discussed.},

We discuss a computational model (in ACT-R, Anderson, 2007) to explain how referring expressions are acquired and used. On the basis of simulations of this model, it is predicted that WM constraints only affect adults' pronoun resolution in stories with a topic shift, but not in stories without a topic shift. This latter prediction was tested in an experiment. The results of this experiment confirm that WM load reduces adults' sensitivity to discourse cues signaling a topic shift, thus influencing their interpretation of subsequent pronouns.},

  Abstract                 = {Results from an experiment with two parts are presented in this paper. In part one, participants listened to sentences containing two, three, four, or five clauses, and were asked questions about the content of the sentences. The results of part one demonstrate that an important unit of representation in sentence memory is the clause, and not some other component of discourse structure. In part two, the same group of participants performed eight different short-term storage/working memory tasks. A composite complex span score was computed for each participant based on three working memory tasks closely based on Daneman \& Carpenter's (1980) reading span task. This working memory measure was significantly correlated with the participants' performance on the sentence memory task in part one. A second working memory measure--N-back--was also significantly correlated with the participants' performance on the sentence memory task, and there was no correlation between their performance on the complex span task and the N-back task. It is therefore concluded that (i) working memory consists of a number of dissociable components; and (ii) memory for sentences taps into more than one of these working memory components. Furthermore, the high correlations of sentence memory with the complex span and the N-back tasks (neither of which are language processing tasks) suggests that memory for sentences is not simply a result of linguistic experience; rather, it is likely that an independent working memory component contributes to participants' performance on the sentence memory task.},

  Abstract                 = {The verbal fluency task requires generation of category exemplars and appears to be an example of what M. Moscovitch (1995) calls a strategic test of memory retrieval. Four experiments explored the role of individual differences in working memory (WM) capacity on verbal fluency under various secondary load conditions. High WM participants consistently recalled more exemplars. However, load conditions caused a decline in recall only for high WM participants. Low WM participants showed no effect of secondary workload on exemplar generation. WM group differences and load effects were observed even in the 1st min of retrieval, which suggests that differences were not due to differences in knowledge. A model of retrieval is supported that relies on cue-based-automatic activation, monitoring of output for errors, controlled suppression of previously recalled items, and controlled strategic search.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding how response time (RT) changes with manipulations has been critical in distinguishing among theories in cognition. It is well known that aggregating data distorts functional relationships (e.g., Estes, 1956). Less well appreciated is a second pitfall: Minimizing squared errors (i.e., OLS regression) also distorts estimated functional forms with RT data. We discuss three properties of RT that should be modeled for accurate analysis and, on the basis of these three properties, provide a hierarchical Weibull regression model for regressing RT onto covariates. Hierarchical regression model analysis of lexical decision task data reveals that RT decreases as a power function of word frequency with the scale of RT decreasing 11\% for every doubling of word frequency. A detailed discussion of the model and analysis techniques are presented as archived materials and may be downloaded from www.psychonomic.org/archive.},

  Abstract                 = {In 3 experiments, the author examined how readers’ eye movements are influenced by joint manipulations of a word’s frequency and the syntactic fit of the word in its context. In the critical conditions of the first 2 experiments, a high- or low-frequency verb was used to disambiguate a garden-path sentence, while in the last experiment, a high- or low-frequency verb constituted a phrase structure violation. The frequency manipulation always influenced the early eye movement measures of first-fixation duration and gaze duration. The context manipulation had a delayed effect in Experiment 1, influencing only the probability of a regressive eye movement from later in the sentence. However, the context manipulation influenced the same early eye movement measures as the frequency effect in Experiments 2 and 3, though there was no statistical interaction between the effects of these variables. The context manipulation also influenced the probability of a regressive eye movement from the verb, though the frequency manipulation did not. These results are shown to confirm predictions emerging from the serial, staged architecture for lexical and integrative processing of the E–Z Reader 10 model of eye movement control in reading (Reichle, Warren, \& McConnell, 2009). It is argued, more generally, that the results provide an important constraint on how the relationship between visual word recognition and syntactic attachment is treated in processing models.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well known that sentences containing object-extracted relative clauses (e.g., The reporter that the senator attacked admitted the error) are more difficult to comprehend than sentences containing subject-extracted relative clauses (e.g., The reporter that attacked the senator admitted the error). Two major accounts of this phenomenon make different predictions about where, in the course of incremental processing of an object relative, difficulty should first appear. An account emphasizing memory processes (Gibson, 1998; Grodner \& Gibson, 2005) predicts difficulty at the relative clause verb, while an account emphasizing experience-based expectations (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) predicts earlier difficulty, at the relative clause subject. Two eye movement experiments tested these predictions. Regressive saccades were much more likely from the subject noun phrase of an object relative than from the same noun phrase occurring within a subject relative (Experiment 1) or within a verbal complement clause (Experiment 2). This effect was further amplified when the relative pronoun that was omitted. However, reading time was also inflated on the object relative clause verb in both experiments. These results suggest that the violation of expectations and the difficulty of memory retrieval both contribute to the difficulty of object relative clauses, but that these two sources of difficulty have qualitatively distinct behavioral consequences in normal reading.},

Both experiments demon- strated processing difficulty on the subject noun phrase of these clauses, in the form of a large number of regressive saccades from both the determiner and the noun. This pro- cessing difficulty was made even more pronounced when the relative pronoun that was absent. In both experiments, difficulty also emerged on the relative clause verb, but in the form of inflated first pass reading time, not in the form of an increase in the regression rate. These findings suggest that the difficulty of object relatives may be due both to the violation of structural expectations and to processes of memory retrieval. However, to the extent that qualitatively distinct eye movement effects can be identified with qual- itatively distinct processing phenomena (admittedly, an open question), the data suggest that different kinds of pro- cessing difficulty may underlie these effects, with},

  Abstract                 = {Readers' eye movements were monitored as they read sentences in which two noun phrases or two independent clauses were connected by the word or (NP-coordination and S-coordination, respectively). The word either could be present or absent earlier in the sentence. When either was present, the material immediately following or was read more quickly, across both sentence types. In addition, there was evidence that readers misanalyzed the S-coordination structure as an NP-coordination structure only when either was absent. The authors interpret the results as indicating that the word either enabled readers to predict the arrival of a coordination structure; this predictive activation facilitated processing of this structure when it ultimately arrived, and in the case of S-coordination sentences, enabled readers to avoid the incorrect NP-coordination analysis. The authors argue that these results support parsing theories according to which the parser can build predictable syntactic structure before encountering the corresponding lexical input.},

  Abstract                 = {Visual cognition is limited by computational capacity, because the brain can process only a fraction of the visual sensorium in detail, and by the inherent ambiguity of the information entering the visual system. Two mechanisms mitigate these burdens: attention prioritizes stimulus processing on the basis of motivational relevance, and expectations constrain visual interpretation on the basis of prior likelihood. Of the two, attention has been extensively investigated while expectation has been relatively neglected. Here, we review recent work that has begun to delineate a neurobiology of visual expectation, and contrast the findings with those of the attention literature, to explore how these two central influences on visual perception overlap, differ and interact.},

  Abstract                 = {Immediate effects of verb-specific syntactic (subcategorization) information were found in a cross-modal naming experiment, a self-paced reading experiment, and an experiment in which eye movements were monitored. In the reading studies, syntactic misanalysis effects in sentence complements (e.g., "The student forgot the solution was...") occurred at the verb in the complement (e.g., was) for matrix verbs typically used with noun phrase complements but not for verbs typically used with sentence complements. In addition, a complementizer effect for sentence-complement-biased verbs was not due to syntactic misanalysis but was correlated with how strongly a particular verb prefers to be followed by the complementizer that. The results support models that make immediate use of lexically specific constraints, especially constraint-based models, but are problematic for lexical filtering models.},

  Abstract                 = {Scientists who study cognition infer underlying processes either by observing behavior (e.g., response times, percentage correct) or by observing neural activity (e.g., the BOLD response). These two types of observations have traditionally supported two separate lines of study. The first is led by cognitive modelers, who rely on behavior alone to support their computational theories. The second is led by cognitive neuroimagers, who rely on statistical models to link patterns of neural activity to experimental manipulations, often without any attempt to make a direct connection to an explicit computational theory. Here we present a flexible Bayesian framework for combining neural and cognitive models. Joining neuroimaging and computational modeling in a single hierarchical framework allows the neural data to influence the parameters of the cognitive model and allows behavioral data, even in the absence of neural data, to constrain the neural model. Critically, our Bayesian approach can reveal interactions between behavioral and neural parameters, and hence between neural activity and cognitive mechanisms. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with applications to simulated fMRI data with a recognition model and to diffusion-weighted imaging data with a response time model of perceptual choice.},

Consequently, good readers have more WM capacity available for the storage of products simply because they have more efficient reading skills.A similar correlation (r = -53) between WM span and the Nelson- Denny, a standardized test of reading com- prehension, was found by Masson and Miller (1983).Daneman and col- leagues argued that the reading span is an index of the WM capacity that is NOT al- located to processing (i.e., reading and comprehending) the individual sentences.Span measures embedded in a processing task other than reading correlated with reading comprehension just as well as did the reading span.neman and Carpenter findings, however, may be that people are good readers be- cause they have a large WM capacity inde- pendent of the task being performed. Good readers may be remembering morenumber of items (digits/words) recalled. The main pur- pose of this pilot study was tnot need to be reading related to lead to a correlation between the span measure and a test of reading comprehension.

The Nelson-Denny correlated significantly with Sentence Word span, r(241) = .37, p .25, MSE = 40.46. In other words, thetwo complex spans requiring the recall of words were similar in their ability to predictreading comprehension as measured by theNelson-Denny.

  Abstract                 = {Two experiments explored the possibility that individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) partially reflect differences in the size of the search set from which items are retrieved. High- and low-WMC individuals were tested in delayed (Experiment 1) and continuous distractor (Experiment 2) free recall with varying list lengths. Across both experiments low-WMC individuals recalled fewer items than high-WMC individuals, recalled more previous list intrusions than high-WMC individuals, and recalled at a slower rate than high-WMC individuals. It is argued that low-WMC individuals' episodic retrieval deficits are partially due to the fact that these individuals search through a larger set of items than high-WMC individuals. Simulations based on a random search model were consistent with these general conclusions.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies examining individual differences in working memory capacity have suggested that individuals with low working memory capacities demonstrate impaired performance on a variety of attention and memory tasks compared with individuals with high working memory capacities. This working memory limitation can be conceived of as arising from 2 components: a dynamic attention component (primary memory) and a probabilistic cue-dependent search component (secondary memory). This framework is used to examine previous individual differences studies of working memory capacity, and new evidence is examined on the basis of predictions of the framework to performance on immediate free recall. It is suggested that individual differences in working memory capacity are partially due to the ability to maintain information accessible in primary memory and the ability to search for information from secondary memory.},

It is shown that this version of Ospan correlates well with other measures of WM capacity and has both good internal consistency (alpha = .78) and test-retest reliability (.83). In addition, the automated version of Ospan (Aospan) was shown to load on the same factor as two other WM measures. This WM capacity factor correlated with a factor composed of fluid abilities measures. The utility of the Aospan was further demonstrated by analyzing response times (RTs) that indicated that RT measures obtained in the task accounted for additional variance in predicting fluid abilities. Our results suggest that Aospan is a reliable and valid indicator of WM capacity that can be applied to a wide array of research domains.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors examined whether people can use their knowledge of the wider discourse rapidly enough to anticipate specific upcoming words as a sentence is unfolding. In an event-related brain potential (ERP) experiment, subjects heard Dutch stories that supported the prediction of a specific noun. To probe whether this noun was anticipated at a preceding indefinite article, stories were continued with a gender-marked adjective whose suffix mismatched the upcoming noun's syntactic gender. Prediction-inconsistent adjectives elicited a differential ERP effect, which disappeared in a no-discourse control experiment. Furthermore, in self-paced reading, prediction-inconsistent adjectives slowed readers down before the noun. These findings suggest that people can indeed predict upcoming words in fluent discourse and, moreover, that these predicted words can immediately begin to participate in incremental parsing operations.},

  Abstract                 = {The parameters of the human memory system constrain the operation of language comprehension processes. In the memory literature, both decay and interference have been proposed as causes of forgetting; however, while there is a long history of research establishing the nature of interference effects in memory, the effects of decay are much more poorly supported. Nevertheless, research investigating the limitations of the human sentence processing mechanism typically focus on decay-based explanations, emphasizing the role of capacity, while the role of interference has received comparatively little attention. This paper reviews both accounts of difficulty in language comprehension by drawing direct connections to research in the memory domain. Capacity-based accounts are found to be untenable, diverging substantially from what is known about the operation of the human memory system. In contrast, recent research investigating comprehension difficulty using a retrieval-interference paradigm is shown to be wholly consistent with both behavioral and neuropsychological memory phenomena. The implications of adopting a retrieval-interference approach to investigating individual variation in language comprehension are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the cue-based retrieval theory of parsing and reanalysis and illustrates how this account can accommodate a number of key results about parsing and reanalysis, including effects due to structure, distance, and type of structural change. Three offline experiments and one online experiment permit establishing the locus of these effects as due to properties of the initial parsing processes or to the repair mechanism. Specifically, the data reported here suggest that a structural factor specific to the operation of the parser, retrieval interference, affects attachment uniformly across ambiguous and unambiguous sentences and serves to create a limit on successful repair. In addition, these experiments suggest that distance of the head of an ambiguous phrase from its disambiguator affects repair processes-and not attachment processes-independently of the interference effect. These results are interpreted with respect to alternative models of reanalysis, which are contrasted with the cue-based retrieval account, which requires no distinct repair mechanism to account for the current results. A further contribution of this article is to suggest a statistical correction for individual variance in reading rates. Statistical analyses on individual subject data confirmed previous speculations regarding a possible increase in reading rates as subjects move through a sentence. While this individual variation limits fair comparisons of reading times in sentence regions that appear in non-identical serial positions, we demonstrate that such comparisons become meaningful when the appropriate regression analyses have been performed.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of interference as a primary determinant of forgetting in memory has long been accepted, however its role as a contributor to poor comprehension is just beginning to be understood. The current paper reports two studies, in which speed-accuracy tradeoff and eye-tracking methodologies were used with the same materials to provide converging evidence for the role of syntactic and semantic cues as mediators of both proactive (PI) and retroactive interference (RI) during comprehension. Consistent with previous work (e.g., Van Dyke \& Lewis, 2003), we found that syntactic constraints at the retrieval site are among the cues that drive retrieval in comprehension, and that these constraints effectively limit interference from potential distractors with semantic/pragmatic properties in common with the target constituent. The data are discussed in terms of a cue-overload account, in which interference both arises from and is mediated through a direct-access retrieval mechanism that utilizes a linear, weighted cue-combinatoric scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of interference effects in sentence processing has recently begun to receive attention, however whether these effects arise during encoding or retrieval remains unclear. This paper draws on basic memory research to help distinguish these explanations and reports data from an experiment that manipulates the possibility for retrieval interference while holding encoding conditions constant. We found clear support for the principle of cue-overload, wherein cues available at retrieval cannot uniquely distinguish among competitors, thus giving rise to interference effects. We discuss the data in relation to a cue-based parsing framework (Van Dyke \{\&\} Lewis, 2003) and other interference effects observed in sentence processing (e.g., Gordon, Hendrick, \{\&\} Johnson, 2001, 2004). We conclude from the available data that the memory system that subserves language comprehension operates according to similar principles as memory in other domains.},
  Annote                   = {Interference is thought to induce cue-overload, where the cues needed to recover an item become associated with many different items in memory and can not reliably elicit any single target (Anderson \& Neely, 1996; Watkins \& Watkins, 1975, 1976) * looked away from displacement or decay explanations and towards accounts that emphasize interference as the major constraint on accessing information in memory (e.g., Anderson \& Neely, 1996; Crowder, 1976; see Nairne, 2002 for a recent review). * the bulk of experimental evidence indicates that the locus of the interference effect is at retrieval, with little or no effect on memory encoding or storage (Dillon \& Bittner, 1975; Gardiner, Craik, \& Birstwistle, 1972; Tehan \& Humphreys, 1996). * If the interference observed in Gordon et al. (2002) study is due to an encoding effect, then the plausibility of the verb should not matter. *** Interference is thought to induce cue-overload, where the cues needed to recover an item become associated with many different items in memory and can not reliably elicit any single target (Anderson \& Neely, 1996; Watkins \& Watkins, 1975, 1976). * Their data indicate that similarity-based interference occurs when the second noun phrase is from the same referential class as the first noun phrase, but it is reduced or eliminated when the noun phrases are from different classes. *interfering and non-interfering conditions vis-\'{a}-vis the words in the memory set, as these words were chosen so that they were either all plausible direct objects for the verb (interfering condition) or implausible direct objects for the verb (non-interfering condition). RESULTS: -such that responses in the Load conditions were more accurate than in the No Load -responses in the non-interfering conditions were more accurate than in the interfering conditions -Region 1the Load condition being significantly slower than the No Load condition -CRITICAL REGION: The effect of Interference was significant by subjects such that the non-interfering conditions were faster than the interfering conditions AND the Load condition being read more quickly (540 ms) than the No Load condition (567 ms)!!! POSTCRIT: Load conditions were read significantly faster than the No Load conditions! -However, reading was slowed in this region when the distracting referents in memory matched the retrieval cues inherent in the verb seeking its object (Interfering/Load condition), relative to conditions in which the distracting referents did not match the verb’s retrieval cues (Non-interfering/Load condition) MY IDEA: load with interference affects retrieval and expectations => slowdown; load with no int affects only expectations => speedup. Maybe with less mem available, the expectations play a bigger role (like with the dif between old and young readers (Titus' paper)},

Distracting information can cause conflict at any level along the information processing stream. However, it is not yet known whether the brain has distinct subsystems dedicated to detecting and resolving these different forms of distraction. Although previous studies have localized brain activity during semantic and response conflict, no prior study has specifically determined whether these activations occur in distinct or overlapping regions. We used a modified version of the Stroop color-word task, by which we were able to separate semantic from response conflict. Behavioral data indicate that these two kinds of conflict both contribute to the overall Stroop interference effect, while fMRI data indicate that they elicit non-overlapping activation in anterior cingulate, prefrontal, and parietal brain regions. These results suggest that the brain has distinct but parallel attentional mechanisms for resolving these different forms of cognitive interference.},

  Abstract                 = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) and reaction times (RTs) were used to study how the processing of sentences with morphosyntactic violations is constrained by working memory (WM) capacity. The available WM capacity was varied by three orthogonal manipulations: (1) syntactic complexity; (2) additional WM load; and (3) verbal WM span. The processing of the morphosyntactic violations was reflected in longer RTs in ungrammatical compared with grammatical sentences, and in an anterior negativity and a centroparietal positivity in the ERPs. While the behavioral grammaticality effect was not influenced by the WM manipulations, the ERP effects were. The amplitude of the anterior negativity was modulated by the combination of complexity and load, and by WM span. The onset of the centroparietal positivity was delayed in the high-load condition, and for the low-span group. ERPs over the course of the sentences showed a frontal negative slow wave under high WM load, largest for the low-span group. The finding that online syntactic processing is related to WM span and to additional WM load does not support the theory that there is a WM capacity specific for syntactic processing.},

  Abstract                 = {One hundred twenty-seven individuals who ranged in age from18 to 90 years were tested on a reading span test and on measures of on-line and off-line sentence processing efficiency. Older participants had reduced working-memory spans compared with younger participants. The on-line measures were sensitive to local increases in processing load, and the off-line measures were sensitive to the syntactic complexity of the sentences. Older and younger participants showed similar effects of syntactic complexity on the on-line measures. There was some evidence that older participants were more affected than younger participants by syntactic complexity on the off-line measures. The results support the hypothesis that on-line processes involved in recognizing linguistic forms and determining the literal, preferred, discourse-coherent meaning of sentences constitute a domain of language processing that relies on its own processing resource or working-memory system.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies indicate that the human brain attends to and uses grammatical gender cues during sentence comprehension. Here, we examine the nature and time course of the effect of gender on word-by-word sentence reading. Event-related brain potentials were recorded to an article and noun, while native Spanish speakers read medium- to high-constraint Spanish sentences for comprehension. The noun either fit the sentence meaning or not, and matched the preceding article in gender or not; in addition, the preceding article was either expected or unexpected based on prior sentence context. Semantically anomalous nouns elicited an N400. Gender-disagreeing nouns elicited a posterior late positivity (P600), replicating previous findings for words. Gender agreement and semantic congruity interacted in both the N400 window--with a larger negativity frontally for double violations--and the P600 window--with a larger positivity for semantic anomalies, relative to the prestimulus baseline. Finally, unexpected articles elicited an enhanced positivity (500-700 msec post onset) relative to expected articles. Overall, our data indicate that readers anticipate and attend to the gender of both articles and nouns, and use gender in real time to maintain agreement and to build sentence meaning.},

  Abstract                 = {Task demands and individual differences have been linked reliably to word skipping during reading. Such differences in ﬁxation probability may imply a selection effect for multivariate analyses of eyemovement corpora if selection effects correlate with word properties of skipped words. For example, with fewer ﬁxations on short and highly frequent words the power to detect parafoveal-on-foveal effects is reduced. We demonstrate that increasing the ﬁxation probability on function words with a manipulation of the expected difﬁculty and frequency of questions reduces an age difference in skipping probability (i.e., old adults become comparable to young adults) and helps to uncover signiﬁcant parafoveal-on-foveal effects in this group of old adults. We discuss implications for the comparison of results of eye-movement research based on multivariate analysis of corpus data with those from display-contingent manipulations of target words.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous psycholinguistics studies have shown that when forming a long distance dependency in online processing, the parser sometimes accepts a sentence even though the required grammatical constraints are only partially met. A mechanistic account of how such errors arise sheds light on both the underlying linguistic representations involved and the processing mechanisms that put such representations together. In the current study, we contrast the negative polarity items (NPI) interference effect, as shown by the acceptance of an ungrammatical sentence like "The bills that democratic senators have voted for will ever become law," with the well-known phenomenon of agreement attraction ("The key to the cabinets are \ldots "). On the surface, these two types of errors look alike and thereby can be explained as being driven by the same source: similarity based memory interference. However, we argue that the linguistic representations involved in NPI licensing are substantially different from those of subject-verb agreement, and therefore the interference effects in each domain potentially arise from distinct sources. In particular, we show that NPI interference at least partially arises from pragmatic inferences. In a self-paced reading study with an acceptability judgment task, we showed NPI interference was modulated by participants' general pragmatic communicative skills, as quantified by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ, Baron-Cohen et al., 2001), especially in offline tasks. Participants with more autistic traits were actually less prone to the NPI interference effect than those with fewer autistic traits. This result contrasted with agreement attraction conditions, which were not influenced by individual pragmatic skill differences. We also show that different NPI licensors seem to have distinct interference profiles. We discuss two kinds of interference effects for NPI licensing: memory-retrieval based and pragmatically triggered.},

  Abstract                 = {This study investigates the neuro-cognitive mechanisms employed to monitor and resolve conflicts between competing sentential representations during sentence comprehension. Participants took part in a sentence comprehension task as well as the flanker and the color-word Stroop tasks while their brain activities were scanned with fMRI. Medial superior frontal gyrus (mSFG), left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and left angular gyrus/inferior parietal lobule (AG/IPL) were more activated for implausible sentences, in which syntactic processes and semantic strategies give rise to incompatible sentential representations, as compared with plausible sentences, in which syntactic processes and semantic strategies point to coherent interpretations. Among them, dorsal mSFG, left IFG, and left IPL constantly responded to the plausibility in sentence comprehension and the congruency in the two perceptual tasks, while anterior mSFG and left AG were specifically sensitive to the sentence plausibility. These results suggest that the domain-general mechanisms of executive control are recruited to deal with conflicts between representations of linguistic inputs.},

  Abstract                 = {Whether left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) activation during sentence comprehension reflects semantic integration or domain-general cognitive control remains unclear. To address this issue, 26 participants were presented with sentences word by word during fMRI scanning and were asked to perform two semantic tasks, one explicit (semantic congruency judgment) and one implicit (font size judgment). In the two language tasks, semantic integration load was parametrically manipulated with high cloze, low cloze and semantically violated sentences. Participants also performed a classical Stroop task during scanning. Conjunction analysis of the explicit and implicit tasks revealed two regions in left inferior frontal gyrus associated with semantic integration load: one anterior region (aIFG) and one posterior region (pIFG). However, only the pIFG region was also activated during the Stroop task. These results indicate that different regions in the LIFG play different roles in semantic integration, with aIFG more important for domain-specific processing and pIFG more important for domain-general cognitive control.},

  abstract = {Seven experiments using self-paced reading and eyetracking suggest that omitting the middle verb in a double centre embedding leads to easier processing in English but leads to greater difficulty in German. One commonly accepted explanation for the English pattern‚Äîbased on data from offline acceptability ratings and due to Gibson and Thomas (1999)‚Äîis that working-memory overload leads the comprehender to forget the prediction of the upcoming verb phrase (VP), which reduces working-memory load. We show that this VP-forgetting hypothesis does an excellent job of explaining the English data, but cannot account for the German results. We argue that the English and German results can be explained by the parser's adaptation to the grammatical properties of the languages; in contrast to English, German subordinate clauses always have the verb in clause-final position, and this property of German may lead the German parser to maintain predictions of upcoming VPs more robustly compared to English. The evidence thus argues against language-independent forgetting effects in online sentence processing; working-memory constraints can be conditioned by countervailing influences deriving from grammatical properties of the language under study.}

 abstract = {Chinese relative clauses are an important test case for pitting the predictions of expectation-based accounts against those of memory-based theories. The memory-based accounts predict that object relatives should be easier to process than subject relatives because, in object relatives, less linguistic material intervenes between the head noun and the gap (or verb) that it associates with. By contrast, expectation-based accounts such as surprisal predict that the less frequently occurring object relative should be harder to process than the subject relative, because building a rarer structure is computationally more expensive. Previous studies on Chinese relative clauses have the problem that local ambiguities in subject and object relatives could be confounding the comparison. We compared reading difficulty in subject and object relatives (in both subject- and object-modifications) in which the left context leads the reader to predict a relative clause structure as the most likely continuation; we validate this assumption about what is predicted using production data (a sentence completion study and a corpus analysis). Two reading studies (self-paced reading and eye-tracking) show that the Chinese relative clause evidence is consistent with the predictions of expectation-based accounts but not with those of memory-based theories. We present new evidence that the prediction of upcoming structure, generated through the probabilistic syntactic knowledge of the comprehender, is an important determiner of processing cost.}

We describe the elicitation of N400s by an impressive range of stimulus types—including written, spoken, and signed words or pseudowords; drawings, photos, and videos of faces, objects, and actions; sounds; and mathematical symbols—and outline the sensitivity of N400 amplitude (as its latency is remarkably constant) to linguistic and nonlinguistic manipulations. We emphasize the effectiveness of the N400 as a dependent variable for examining almost every aspect of language processing and highlight its expanding use to probe semantic memory and to determine how the neurocognitive system dynamically and flexibly uses bottom-up and top-down information to make sense of the world. We conclude with different theories of the N400's functional significance and offer an N400-inspired reconceptualization of how meaning processing might unfold. }

  abstract = {Comprehension of non-canonical sentences can be difficult for individuals with aphasia (IWA). It is still unclear to which extent morphological cues like case-marking or verb inflection may influence IWA’s performance or even help to override deficits in sentence comprehension. Until now, studies have mainly used offline methods to draw inferences about syntactic deficits and, so far, only a few studies have looked at online syntactic processing in aphasia. We investigated sentence processing in German IWA by combining an offline (sentence-picture matching) and online (eye-tracking in the visual-world paradigm) method. Our goal was to determine whether IWA are capable of using inflectional morphology (number-agreement markers on verbs and case markers in noun phrases) as a cue to sentence interpretation. We report results of two visual-world experiments using German reversible SVO and OVS sentences. In each study, there were eight IWA and 20 age-matched controls. Experiment 1 targeted the role of case-morphology, while Experiment 2 looked at processing of number-agreement cues at the verb in case-ambiguous sentences. IWA showed deficits in using both types of morphological markers as a cue to non-canonical sentence interpretation and the results indicate that in aphasia, processing of case-marking cues is more vulnerable as compared to verb-agreement morphology. However, the online data revealed that IWA are in principle capable of successfully computing morphological cues, but the integration of morphological information is delayed as compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, we found striking differences between controls and IWA regarding subject-before-object parsing predictions. While in case-unambiguous sentences IWA showed evidence for early subject-before-object parsing commitments, they exhibited no straightforward subject-first bias in case-ambiguous sentences, although controls did so for ambiguous structures. IWA delayed their parsing decisions in case-ambiguous sentences until unambiguous morphological information, such as a subject-verb-number-agreement cue, was available. We attribute the differential results for processing of case and agreement markers to differences in the degree of reliability of both morphological cues. We ascribe our findings for erroneous processing of case-unambiguous sentences in aphasia to late parsing commitments and failures in integrating case cues on time. For processing of case-ambiguous sentences in aphasia, we suggest that IWA adopt a wait-and-see strategy and make parsing commitments only when the agreement cue at the verb prompts a particular sentence structure. Our results for IWA further point to deficits in predictive processes during sentence comprehension.},
