<h3>Current Issues in Sentence Comprehension (東京大学)</h3>

In this course, we will read some of the recent literature on retrieval and prediction processes in sentence comprehension. I will start by discussing some recent work on retrieval from my own lab. But most of the focus will be on predictive processes, because I think there some interesting open issues there, and because Japanese seems like a really good language to study the open problems in predictive parsing.

<br>

<strong>Prerequisities</strong>: Some background and interest in sentence comprehension research is desirable.<br>

<strong>Syllabus and readings</strong>: 

The syllabus is provided 
<a href="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/courses/CurrentIssuesTokyo.pdf">here</a> as a pdf.
Readings are provided as a zip archive, password protected: download from <a href="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/courses/ReadingList.zip">here</a>. I will give out the 
password in class.
 </ol>
<br>
<strong>Slides</strong>: To be provided.
<br>

<br>
<strong>Approximate schedule</strong>: 
<br>

Please look at the reading list in the pdf for the references (the articles will be released as a zip archive to participants). The general style of the lectures will be that I will present the material in class, and the participants should feel free to interrupt and discuss the points that come up. Since everything in this work is highly dependent on statistical methods, I will occasionally make excursions into that area to illustrate a particular point. Also, I will discuss other papers that are not on the list, when this makes sense.<br>

<strong>Active participation is strongly encouraged!</strong>

<ol>
<li>
１０月２１日: In this lecture, I will talk about some of the major issues my lab is working on; this will be a sort of 自己紹介, but also prepares the way for the rest of the readings and puts them in the context of my own research interests.<br>

Background notes (may be useful if you are new to sentence comprehension research): <a href="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/courses/pdfs/IntroPsychLxOverview.pdf">here</a>.
</li>

<li>
１０月２８日: My introductory lecture will be continued on this day. I will introduce some of the work from my lab, as a way to motivate the rest of the readings and to put them in a broader context.

<strong>Slides 01 (lectures 1 and 2)</strong>:

１１月０４日: 
Here, I will talk about the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/felix-engelmann/b6/a42/ba3">Engelmann</a> et al paper (reading 1), which is currently under review. This paper represents a major attempt on our part to try to understand the diversity of the data on dependency resolution processes. It's a bit complicated and I don't expect people to read it closely; I will unpack the highlights of the paper for you.
<br>

<strong>Slides (lecture 3)</strong>: <a href="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/courses/pdfs/Tokyo2015_01EngelmannEtAl.pdf">here</a>.<br>

<strong>Engelmann's Shiny App</strong> for simulating the model's behavior is <a href="https://engelmann.shinyapps.io/ACTRInterference/">here</a>.

１１月１１日: 
Here, I will talk about two papers that give some representative findings about expectation effects (readings 2 and 3). I think that Japanese is a great language to study predictive parsing, so maybe we can get some discussion started on the open questions in expectation-based processing and how to address them with new experiment designs involving Japanese.

<br>The slides are <a href="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/courses/pdfs/Tokyo2015_Readings0203.pdf">here</a>.<br>

<br> <a href="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/courses/Papers.zip">Here</a> are the ERP papers I mentioned.
</li>

<li>
１１月１８日: 
In this lecture, I will talk about readings 4 and 5. The experiment involving Chinese relatives is interesting in many ways because the history of Chinese relative clause research is a truly bizarre and fantastic one, and worthy of study in its own right as a case study of psycholinguistics.

The slides, which only cover the Linzen and Jaeger paper, are <a href="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/courses/pdfs/Tokyo2015_Readings0405.pdf">here</a>.<br>

</li>


<li>
１１月２５日 
In this lecture, I will talk about three papers (readings 6-8) on a topic is especially interesting for head-final languages: ungrammatical center embeddings. In English, these can be rather bizarre, but in German, triple center embeddings are not that uncommon in formal writing. We will discuss some of the explanations for why ungrammatical triple CEs are considered good in English (compared to their grammatical counterparts) and why grammatical ones are better in German (compared to their grammatical counterparts). Haeussler and Bader have an interesting alternative position on this that we will also discuss.

The slides are <a href="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/courses/pdfs/Tokyo2015_Readings06-08.pdf">here</a>.

</li>

<li>
１２月０２日 
In this lecture we will shift gears and look at some work from the Maryland group on gap filling, and the timing of verb selection in Japanese sentence production (readings 9, 10). The first paper is about unexpected verb continuations after the pre-verbal structure raises some expectations about the upcoming verb (type), and the second paper addresses incrementality in production. 
<strong>I will also discuss the replication results of the Levy and Keller 2013 paper we discussed some time back.</strong>
<br>
The slides for the replication of Levy and Keller 2013 are <a href="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/courses/pdfs/Tokyo2015_LevyKellerReplication1.pdf">here</a>.

<li>
１２月０９日 
This class had to be cancelled. 
</li>

<li>
１２月１６日 
We thought a bit about the big picture, and ended with discussing the bag-of-arguments papers by Wing Yee Chow and colleagues. Slides <a href="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/courses/pdfs/Tokyo2015_ReadingsFinal.pdf">here</a>.

</ol>


<strong>Grading</strong>: Grading will be based on a short report (2-3 pages at most) on one or more of the papers discussed in the course.  The report can be in Japanese, German, French, English, or Hindi.  Extra credit will be given for original ideas/proposals in the summary, and for class participation. If you come up with a new experiment design that attempts to resolve an open question, then you are very likely to get a high score.
<strong>Submission deadline: 15 January 2016 midnight, Japan time.</strong>
