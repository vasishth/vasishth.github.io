<h4>Motivation: What this course is about</h4>

Sentence comprehension, a field of research within psycholinguistics, is concerned with the study of the cognitive processes that unfold when we hear or read a sentence. The focus is on developing theories and models about how sentence comprehension (parsing) works.

The last sixty years have seen significant advances in our understanding of sentence comprehension processes. However, the vast majority of this work is experiment-based, with theory-development being largely limited to paper-pencil models. 
Although we have learnt a great deal from such informal reasoning about cognitive processes, ultimately the only way to test a theory is to implement it as a
computational model. 
This is a standard approach in research on cognition in artificial intelligence, computer science, and mathematical psychology. Indeed, history has shown that the development of different computational cognitive architectures and mathematical models of cognition has had a huge impact in advancing our understanding of cognitive processes. 
This is because computational and mathematical models force the scientist to make detailed commitments, which can then be tested empirically.

The present course brings together these two cultures: informally developed theories of sentence comprehension, and computational/mathematical models of cognition. We develop a series of accounts of sentence comprehension within a 
specific cognitive architecture that has been developed for modeling general cognitive processes, the <a href="http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/">ACT-R architecture (version 6.0)</a>. 
ACT-R is a good choice because it is a mature architecture that has been widely used in artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, psychology, and psycholinguistics to study cognitive processes.

Some of the issues that have been addressed empirically in sentence comprehension research are: (a) 
the influence of individual differences in capacity on parsing, (b) the role of parsing strategy, including task-dependent underspecification, (c)  the role of probabilistic expectations, (d) the interaction between grammatical knowledge and parsing, (e) the interaction between the eye-movement control system and sentence comprehension, and (f) how impaired processing might arise (e.g., in aphasia). We address all of these topics by presenting computational models of representative phenomena using the ACT-R framework. The source code for the model is already freely available on github:<br><br>

<h3>Tentative outline</h3>
 
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Day 1: Review of the state of the art in theories of sentence comprehension</strong>

We review the classical theories of sentence comprehension, and then some of the more recent proposals (e.g., good enough processing, unrestricted race model). We discuss the empirical coverage of these alternative theories, and the connection with general theories of cognitive processes.<br>

<!--
Shravan:
30 mins Start with big picture of sentence processing: classical models (Frazier), syntax first vs constraint based vs connectionist, serial parallel debate, unrestricted race model, good-enough, surprisal+entropy, retrieval (use Felix figures to give intuition about cue based retrieval). 
40 mins Talk in some detail about the literature on interference effects (briefly allude to the psych literature on interference (subject-verb, agrmt attraction, reflexives, NPIs). Talk about ind diffs. 
10 mins Mathematical details of retrieval constraints.
10 mins Talk about installing the system, walk them through the git clone process and workflow
-->

<li> <strong>Day 2: Modeling sentence comprehension as a cognitive process: An introduction to the framework</strong>

Here, we take up an approach that we have explored in our own research: using the ACT-R architecture to model human sentence comprehension processes.
In order to allow the student to use the models presented in the rest of the course, the lecture will provide a high-level and largely self-contained introduction to building sentence comprehension models in the cognitive architecture ACT-R.  

First, we will provide a quick introduction to ACT-R. Then, the revised implementation of the original Lewis and Vasishth 2005 model will be presented in detail. <br>

<!-- 
40 mins Shravan: Introduce ACT-R constructs needed for LV05 model using unit 5
50 mins Felix: Introduce core sentence processing system 

This will be an interactive session.

We will be available on this day to help people install ACT-R and ccl.

</li>

<li><strong>Day 3: Modeling the eye-parser connection</strong>

The ACT-R architecture has the capability to ask questions that until recently have not been addressed computationally.
One important example is the eye-parser connection: does the parsing system interact with the eye-movement control system, and if so, what is the nature of this interaction? 
In this section, we briefly introduce the coupling of the eye-movement control system  and the parser within ACT-R, and how this coupling can be parametrically varied to explore different assumptions.<br>

<!-- 
30 mins Shravan: introduce big picture of eye-movements and parsing (Mitchell, Meseguer, Frazier and Rayner), GE processing, aphasia

<li>
<strong>Day 4: The empirical coverage of the framework</strong>

Our main focus will be on applying the architecture described above to model a range of experimental results in the literature relating to classical phenomena such as interference, locality/anti-locality,  garden-pathing. We also discuss implementations of good-enough processing and the unrestricted race model, models of individual differences in parsing, and models of impaired sentence comprehension in aphasic patients.<br>
